Reasons for psychiatric disorders in somatically ill patients are variable and can lead to or be a result of the physical illness or just occur coincidentally. Consultation-liaison services (C/L) assist the physician and the treatment team on internal surgical wards in general hospitals in paying attention to and caring for somatic psychiatric comorbidities with diagnostic, therapeutic and, if appropriate, secondary preventative methods. In this article an overview of the development of C/L psychiatry is given. Furthermore, the importance of particular psychiatric disorders seen by psychiatric C/L services and their treatment is described. Finally, specific aspects of service delivery with regard to collaborative care between general hospital physicians and private practitioners are discussed.",

We found that a functional polymorphism altering chromatin interaction between the transcription start site and long-range enhancers in the FK506 binding protein 5 (FKBP5) gene, an important regulator of the stress hormone system, increased the risk of developing stress-related psychiatric disorders in adulthood by allele-specific, childhood trauma-dependent DNA demethylation in functional glucocorticoid response elements of FKBP5. This demethylation was linked to increased stress-dependent gene transcription followed by a long-term dysregulation of the stress hormone system and a global effect on the function of immune cells and brain areas associated with stress regulation. This identification of molecular mechanisms of genotype-directed long-term environmental reactivity will be useful for designing more effective treatment strategies for stress-related disorders.",

        "medline_abstract_text":"Retained respiratory tract (RT) secretions, infection, and exuberant inflammatory responses are core abnormalities in cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease. Factors contributing to the destructive CF airway inflammatory processes remain incompletely characterized. The pro-oxidative inflammatory CF RT milieu is known to contain enzymatically and nonenzymatically produced regulatory lipid mediators, a panel of structurally defined oxidized metabolites of polyunsaturated fatty acids known to play a role in pathology related to inflammation. Using an extraction protocol that maximizes recoveries of sputum-spiked deuterated standards, coupled with an LC/MS/MS detection system, this study presents a metabolomic method to assess a broad spectrum of regulatory lipid mediators in freshly obtained sputum from CF patients. A broad range of both proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory lipid mediators was detected, including PGE2, PGD2, TXB2, LTB4, 6-trans-LTB4, 20-OH-LTB4, 20-COOH-LTB4, 20-HETE, 15-HETE, 11-HETE, 12-HETE, 8-HETE, 9-HETE, 5-HETE, EpETrEs, diols, resolvin E1, 15-deoxy-PGJ2, and LXA4. The vast majority of these oxylipins have not been reported previously in CF RT secretions. Whereas direct associations of individual proinflammatory lipid mediators with compromised lung function (FEV-1) were observed, the relationships were not robust. However, multiple statistical analyses revealed that the regulatory lipid mediators profile taken in aggregate proved to have a stronger association with lung function in relatively stable outpatient adult CF patients. Our data reveal a relative paucity of the anti-inflammatory lipid mediator lipoxin A4 in CF sputum. Patients displaying detectable levels of the anti-inflammatory lipid mediator resolvin E1 demonstrated a better lung function compared to those patients with undetectable levels. Our data suggest that comprehensive metabolomic profiling of regulatory lipid mediators in CF sputum should contribute to a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying CF RT inflammatory pathobiology. Further studies are required to determine the extent to which nutritional or pharmacological interventions alter the regulatory lipid mediators profile of the CF RT and the impact of potential modulations of RT regulatory lipid mediators on the clinical progression of CF lung disease.",

Evaluation of the efficacy of these agents is limited by heterogeneity in outcomes definition and the small number of comparative studies. We provide a systematic review of clinical trials (CTs) related to DED treatment and a critical appraisal of CT public databases. CT reports obtained from eight databases were reviewed, as well as public free-access electronic databases for CT registration. Data evaluation was based on endpoints such as symptoms, Schirmer test, ocular surface staining scores, recruitment of patients, type and efficacy of the drug, and the design and site of performance of the study. Forty-nine CTs were evaluated involving 5,189 patients receiving DED treatment. Heterogeneity in study design prevented meta-analysis from yielding meaningful results, and a descriptive analysis of these studies was conducted. The most frequent categories of drugs for DED in these studies were artificial tears, followed by anti-inflammatory drugs and secretagogues. Although 116 studies have been completed, according to the registration database for clinical trials, only 17 of them (15.5%) were published. Out of 185 registered CTs related to DED, 72% were performed in the USA. The pharmaceutical industry sponsored 78% of them. The identification of effective DED treatment strategies is hindered by the lack of an accepted set of definitive criteria for evaluating disease severity. ",

Catecholamines are known to regulate thermogenesis and metabolic rate in mammals, but their roles in other animals are poorly understood. The fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, has been used as a model system for the genetic studies of temperature preference behavior. Here, we demonstrate that metabolic rate and temperature sensitivity of some temperature sensitive behaviors are regulated by dopamine in Drosophila. Temperature-sensitive molecules like dTrpA1 and shi(ts) induce temperature-dependent behavioral changes, and the temperature at which the changes are induced were lowered in the dopamine transporter-defective mutant, fumin. The mutant also displays a preference for lower temperatures. This thermophobic phenotype was rescued by the genetic recovery of the dopamine transporter in dopamine neurons. Flies fed with a dopamine biosynthesis inhibitor (3-iodo-L-tyrosine), which diminishes dopamine signaling, exhibited preference for a higher temperature. Furthermore, we found that the metabolic rate is up-regulated in the fumin mutant. Taken together, dopamine has functions in the temperature sensitivity of behavioral changes and metabolic rate regulation in Drosophila, as well as its previously reported functions in arousal/sleep regulation.",

With this targeted review we summarize the current state of knowledge in order to provide insight in this developing field.

The concept of long-term risk is rarely used in nephrology research. This paper focuses on two long-term risk measures-lifetime risk and life expectancy. Lifetime risk is an epidemiologic measure that expresses the probability that a person who is currently free of the condition will acquire it at some time during the remainder of their expected lifespan. Life expectancy is the expected number of years of life remaining for a given group of individuals at a specified age. Key data required for estimation of lifetime risk and life expectancy are disease incidence and mortality derived by considering age in the time scale in a longitudinal study. Lifetime risks can be estimated from incidence and mortality rates derived from prospective studies whereas mortality rates are required to estimate life expectancy. Although short-term risks are important, long-term risk can be particularly beneficial for future prediction of the burden of kidney disease, and to assist in health planning and public education.",

Anything that is both cheaper and better, but is not actually the dominant therapy, must have other drawbacks that prevent replacement of all dialysis treatments by transplantation. The barriers to universal transplantation as the therapy for end-stage kidney disease include the economic limitations which, in some countries, place transplantation, appropriately, at a lower priority than public health fundamentals such as clean water, sanitation, and vaccination. Even in high-income countries, the technical challenges of surgery and the consequences of immunosuppression restrict the number of suitable recipients, but the major finite restrictions on kidney transplantation rates are the shortage of donated organs and the limited medical, surgical, and nursing workforces with the required expertise. These problems have solutions which involve the full range of societal, professional, governmental, and political environments.

We assessed repeatability and diagnostic performance of (1) LCI measured earlier from three MBW runs and (2) LCI measured at complete MBW (1/40th of starting N2 concentration) from two runs only. Compared with the standard LCI from three complete MBW runs, the new LCI based on three N2MBW runs until 1/20th, or two complete runs until 1/40th, provided similar or better repeatability as well as sensitivity and specificity for CF lung disease. Alternative ways to measure LCI reduced test duration in children with CF by 30% and 41%, respectively. LCI measurements can be reliably shortened in children.

The MDS-UPDRS was translated into Italian and tested in 377 native-Italian speaking PD patients. Confirmatory and exploratory factor analyses determined whether the factor structure for the English-language MDS-UPDRS could be confirmed in data collected using the Italian translation. To be designated an 'Official MDS translation,' the Comparative Fit Index (CFI) had to be ≥0.90 relative to the English-language version. For all four parts of the Italian MDS-UPDRS, the CFI, in comparison with the English-language data, was ≥0.94. Exploratory factor analyses revealed some differences between the two datasets, however these differences were considered to be within an acceptable range.

There have been several updates and revisions to this manual and, regardless of its a theoretical framework, it actually does have a framework and presupposition. Essentially the DSM dictates that all psychiatric disorders are syndromes, or a collection of symptoms that commonly occur together and impair psychosocial functioning. These syndromes allow for homogenous groups of patients to be studied and psychotherapies and pharmacotherapies to be developed. This editorial will examine the DSM system with regards to its applicability to central nervous system dysfunction where psychiatric disorders are concerned. Specifically, the brain does not follow categorical, or syndromal, constructs. In fact, the psychiatric patient likely inherits several risk genes that promote abnormal proteins along several neuropathways in the brain. These abnormalities create dysfunctional neurocircuits which create individual psychiatric symptoms, but not a categorical syndrome or diagnosis. The concept that the DSM may be excellent for clinical diagnostic purposes, but less correct in its assumptions for a psychopharmacologist's treatment approaches will be discussed.",

Using a constructivist methodology, in-depth interviews were conducted with five people who were receiving haemodialysis in two small satellite dialysis units located in regional and rural communities in New South Wales, Australia. Thematic analysis revealed two types of patients. The first type appears to adopt a received view of information, who do not question their condition; and passively accept information. In the other type, patients were found to be engaged; they actively identified their information needs and quickly learned what that they needed to ask and who to ask. Knowing the information practices of people with ESKD is useful for nephrology nurses when providing patient education.",

To determine if this is true for Mycobacterium intracellulare, household water sources for 36 patients with Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) lung disease were evaluated. MAC household water isolates from three published studies that included 37 additional MAC respiratory disease patients were also evaluated. Species identification was done initially using nonsequencing methods with confirmation by internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and/or partial 16S rRNA gene sequencing. M. intracellulare was identified by nonsequencing methods in 54 respiratory cultures and 41 household water/biofilm samples. By ITS sequencing, 49 (90.7%) respiratory isolates were M. intracellulare and 4 (7.4%) were Mycobacterium chimaera. In contrast, 30 (73%) household water samples were M. chimaera, 8 (20%) were other MAC X species (i.e., isolates positive with a MAC probe but negative with species-specific M. avium and M. intracellulare probes), and 3 (7%) were M. avium; none were M. intracellulare. In comparison, M. avium was recovered from 141 water/biofilm samples. These results indicate that M. intracellulare lung disease in the United States is acquired from environmental sources other than household water. Nonsequencing methods for identification of nontuberculous mycobacteria (including those of the MAC) might fail to distinguish closely related species (such as M. intracellulare and M. chimaera). This is the first report of M. chimaera recovery from household water. The study underscores the importance of taxonomy and distinguishing the many species and subspecies of the MAC.",

Autophagy is the process of cellular catabolism through the lysosomal-dependent machinery, which maintains a balance among protein synthesis, degradation, and recycling of self. Autophagy is part of normal homeostasis and it can be triggered by multiple factors that threaten cell integrity, including starvation, toxins, or pathogens. Multiple factors regulate autophagy; survival and preservation of cellular integrity at the expense of inadequately folded proteins and damaged high-energy generating intracellular organelles are prominent targets of autophagy in pathological conditions. Coincidentally, inadequately folded proteins accumulate and high-energy generating intracellular organelles, such as mitochondria, are damaged by alcohol abuse; these alcohol-induced pathological findings prompted investigation of the role of autophagy in the pathogenesis of alcohol-induced liver damage.

However, little attention has been given to the physiological and behavioral changes promoted by stress during this period of ontogeny. In the present study we investigated, in adolescent male rats, the effects of repeated exposure to restraint or variable stress on: (a) locomotor activity and corticosterone levels after exposure to a novel environment; (b) corticosterone levels in response to the exposure to restraint stress; and (c) changes in body, thymus and adrenal weights. The results demonstrated that repeated exposure to restraint or variable stress reduced the locomotor response, but did not affect corticosterone secretion, in response to a novel environment. Moreover, both chronic stress procedures did not change corticosterone secretion in response to acute restraint stress. Furthermore, our results showed that repeated restraint, but not variable stress, produced a decrease in body weight along the stress exposure. Finally, we observed that the exposure to variable stress reduced the thymus relative weight. Taken together our results suggest that behavioral and physiological changes induced by exposure to chronic stress during adolescence depend on the stress regimen.",

The present study was designed to detect the systematic alterations of renal cortex metabolites thereby exploring the related mechanisms of DKD development and fosinopril treatment. Based on combined gas chromatography/time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOF MS) and liquid chromatography/time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-TOF MS) data acquiring platform, we have performed a metabolomic analysis of perfused renal cortex samples from the diabetic rats induced by streptozocin and treated with or without fosinopril, a pharmacological inhibitor of angiotensin II converting enzyme (ACEI). We identified a number of abnormal metabolites in the diabetic kidney, including groups of amino acids, carbohydrates, polyols, lyso-phospholipids, glucuronides and other unidentified metabolites. Of them, an increase in intrarenal organic toxins including uremic toxins, glucuronides and glucotocixity-associated metabolites are highly correlated with diabetic kidney injury including 24h urinary protein levels and tubulointerstitial injury index. Treatment with fosinopril significantly attenuated diabetic kidney injury, and simultaneously blocked the intrarenal accumulation of these organic toxins, especially hippurate and glucuronides. These results indicate that intrarenal accumulation of organic toxins may be significant for the development of DKD and the related mechanisms deserve to be further investigated.",

However, the mechanism underlying this physiological response has remained largely undefined. Here we address this question using a novel panel of mice in which expression of the thromboxane receptor (TP) has been genetically manipulated. We show that the response of the airways to TXA(2) is complex: it depends on expression of other G protein-coupled receptors but also on the physiological context of the signal. In the healthy airway, TXA(2)-mediated airway constriction depends on expression of TP receptors by smooth muscle cells. In contrast, in the inflamed lung, the direct actions of TXA(2) on smooth muscle cell TP receptors no longer contribute to bronchoconstriction. Instead, in allergic lung disease, TXA(2)-mediated airway constriction depends on neuronal TP receptors. Furthermore, this mechanistic switch persists long after resolution of pulmonary inflammation. Our findings demonstrate the powerful ability of lung inflammation to modify pathways leading to airway constriction, resulting in persistent changes in mechanisms of airway reactivity to key bronchoconstrictors. Such alterations are likely to shape the pathogenesis of asthmatic lung disease.",

Our laboratory previously demonstrated that IL-22 plays an important role in ameliorating liver injury in many rodent models by targeting hepatocytes that express high levels of IL-22R1 and IL-10R2. Recently, we have identified high expression levels of IL-22R1 and IL-10R2 in liver progenitor cells and hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). Overexpression of IL-22 in vivo or treatment with IL-22 in vitro promotes proliferation of liver progenitor cells via a signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3)-dependent mechanism. IL-22 treatment also prevents HSC apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. Surprisingly, overexpression of IL-22, via either gene targeting or exogenous administration of adenovirus expressing IL-22, reduces liver fibrosis and accelerates the resolution of liver fibrosis during recovery. The anti-fibrotic effects of IL-22 are mediated via the activation of STAT3 in HSCs and subsequent induction of suppressor of cytokine signaling 3, which induces HSC senescence. Taken together, the hepatoprotective, mitogenic, and anti-fibrotic effects of IL-22 are beneficial in ameliorating alcoholic liver injury. Importantly, due to the restricted expression of IL-22R1, IL-22 therapy is expected to have few side effects, thus making IL-22 a potential candidate for treatment of alcoholic liver disease. ",

Urinary excretion of administered lactulose increased from 0.30% to 0.50% of the initial dose during the first treatment period in the placebo group, and from 0.13% to 0.33% in the rebamipide group. Despite recovery from small-intestinal mucosal damage, the increased permeability in both groups resulted in sustained high levels of lactulose (0.50% to 1.06% in the placebo group and 0.33% to 1.12% in the rebamipide group) through the 4-week washout period. Diclofenac administration induced enteropathy and hyperpermeability of the small intestine. The sustained hyperpermeability during the washout period may indicate the presence of invisible fragility.

The outcome of treatment for NTM lung disease is poor, particularly lung disease caused by Mycobacterium simiae and M. abscessus. Exploring synergy between active available drugs is a sensible way forward given the lack of new active drugs. We tested for synergy between amikacin and clofazimine, using standardized methods, in 564 consecutive clinical isolates identified as 21 species of rapidly growing mycobacteria, 16 clinical M. avium complex isolates, and 10 M. simiae isolates. Clofazimine and amikacin are each active in vitro against NTM; 97% (n = 548) of the rapid growers revealed MICs of clofazimine of ≤1 μg/ml, and 93% (n = 524) proved susceptible to amikacin. The combination showed significant synergistic activity in 56 of 68 (82%) eligible M. abscessus isolates, 4 of 5 M. chelonae isolates, and 1 M. fortuitum and 1 M. cosmeticum isolate, with 4- to 8-fold decreases in MICs to both drugs. Significant synergy could also be demonstrated against all M. avium complex and M. simiae isolates, with fractional inhibitory concentrations of <0.5. Clofazimine and amikacin show significant synergistic activity against both rapidly and slowly growing nontuberculous mycobacteria. The safety and tolerability of adding clofazimine to amikacin-containing regimens should be tested in clinical trials, and the results of susceptibility tests for these two compounds and their combination merit clinical validation.

We previously reported that HE4 is also expressed in pulmonary adenocarcinoma. The purpose of this study was to investigate serum levels of HE4 as a biological marker in pulmonary adenocarcinoma. As the trained set, 102 patients with pulmonary adenocarcinoma who underwent surgery in our institute from 2008 to 2011 were evaluated. They were compared with 58 healthy controls and 16 cases of benign lung disease. In the validation, we used 104 patients with pulmonary adenocarcinoma operated on between 2000 and 2007. Postoperative changes of serum HE4 levels were investigated in 35 patients. The level of HE4 was determined by enzyme immunometric assay and compared with clinicopathological factors. In the trained set, HE4 levels in sera in pulmonary adenocarcinoma were significantly higher than in healthy controls and benign lung disease. Receiver operating characteristic curve showed that HE4 was a good discriminator of pulmonary adenocarcinoma (cut-off point, 50.3 pM; area under curve, 0.825; 95 % confidence interval, 0.76-0.89, p < 0.001). In the validation set, serum HE4 levels were significantly correlated with age, nodal status, and carcinoembryonic antigen. Furthermore, postoperative increase of HE4 serum levels showed a significant correlation with recurrence (p = 0.032). The 5-year overall survival rate was 52.6 % in the HE4-positive group compared with 97.1 % in the HE4-negative group (p = 0.001).

An automatic algorithm was used to detect sleep spindles and to quantify their characteristics (i.e., density, amplitude, and duration). Analyses revealed significant positive correlations between gains in performance and the amplitude of spindles. Moreover, significant increases in BOLD signal were observed in several motor-related areas, most of which were localized in the right hemisphere, particularly in the right cortico-striatal system. Such increases in BOLD signal also correlated positively with the amplitude of spindles at several derivations.

The present study was undertaken to determine the interaction between dietary zinc deficiency and ethanol consumption in the pathogenesis of alcoholic liver disease. C57BL/6N mice were subjected to 8-week feeding of 4 experimental liquid diets: (1) zinc adequate diet, (2) zinc adequate diet plus ethanol, (3) zinc deficient diet, and (4) zinc deficient diet plus ethanol. Ethanol exposure with adequate dietary zinc resulted in liver damage as indicated by elevated plasma alanine aminotransferase level and increased hepatic lipid accumulation and inflammatory cell infiltration. Dietary zinc deficiency alone increased hepatic lipid contents, but did not induce hepatic inflammation. Dietary zinc deficiency showed synergistic effects on ethanol-induced liver damage. Dietary zinc deficiency exaggerated ethanol effects on hepatic genes related to lipid metabolism and inflammatory response. Dietary zinc deficiency worsened ethanol-induced imbalance between hepatic pro-oxidant and antioxidant enzymes and hepatic expression of cell death receptors. Dietary zinc deficiency exaggerated ethanol-induced reduction of plasma leptin, although it did not affect ethanol-induced reduction of white adipose tissue mass. Dietary zinc deficiency also deteriorated ethanol-induced gut permeability increase and plasma endotoxin elevation. These results demonstrate, for the first time, that dietary zinc deficiency is a risk factor in alcoholic liver disease, and multiple intrahepatic and extrahepatic factors may mediate the detrimental effects of zinc deficiency.

But neuroimaging experiments, which give insights into the neurobiological correlates of stress × sex interactions in fear conditioning, are lacking so far. In the current functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, we tested whether a psychosocial stressor (Trier Social Stress Test) compared to a control condition influenced subsequent fear conditioning in 48 men and 48 women taking oral contraceptives (OCs). One of two pictures of a geometrical figure was always paired (conditioned stimulus, CS+) or never paired (CS-) with an electrical stimulation (unconditioned stimulus). BOLD responses as well as skin conductance responses were assessed. Sex-independently, stress enhanced the CS+/CS- differentiation in the hippocampus in early acquisition but attenuated conditioned responses in the medial frontal cortex in late acquisition. In early acquisition, stress reduced the CS+/CS- differentiation in the nucleus accumbens in men, but enhanced it in OC women. In late acquisition, the same pattern (reduction in men, enhancement in OC women) was found in the amygdala as well as in the anterior cingulate. Thus, psychosocial stress impaired the neuronal correlates of fear learning and expression in men, but facilitated them in OC women.

It is even more difficult to understand the basis for abnormal behaviour, disturbed emotions, and impaired cognitions, something mental health professionals are trying for long. In these pursuits, psychiatry has traversed through eras of humours, witchcraft, spirits, psychoanalysis, and gradually deviated from other medical specialities. Now, with recent biological breakthroughs like advances in psychopharmacology, neuroimaging and genetics, increasingly more emphasis is being given to the biological model of psychiatric disorders. These new biological models have given a more scientific appearance to the speciality. It has also revolutionised the management strategies and outcome of many psychiatric disorders. However, this rapid development in biological understanding of psychiatry also leads to a new wave of reductionism. In an attempt to deduce everything in terms of neurons, neurochemicals, and genes, can we neglect psychosocial aspects of mental health? Patients' personality, expectations, motives, family background, sociocultural backgrounds continue to affect mental health no matter how much 'biological' psychiatry gets.

But we cannot forget that major therapeutic advances result when we are able to delineate commonalities and stable symptom clusters that cut across geo-cultural boundaries and are amenable to study and intervention. Even though the purpose and approach of psychiatry, as of all medicine, has to be humane and caring, major therapeutic advancements and aetiologic understandings result only from a scientific methodology that stresses and figures out the commonalities of psychopathological phenomena. It is a mistake to stress individuality so much that commonalities are obliterated. Although stress on the individual's needs has helped psychiatry at times become more humane, it has hurt the task enormously by making some very bright minds question the very scientific basis of psychiatry and its status as a medical discipline. Hence, even as it is necessary to promote holistic and individualistic caring, it is equally necessary to shrug ambivalence and crippling disagreements that can result if individualism in therapy is carried beyond limits. Psychiatry's tradition, and field, will always allow for diversity in its practice, even in its theorising. For, psychopathology has both a personal, deep inner dimension - due to biogenetic and personality factors - and social, manifest/unmanifest, outer dimension - due to the environment. And the practice, and theory, of both are likely to be different, although we do try to amalgamate them in our 'bio-psycho-social' model. Such differences are only manifestations of an intricate network of influences that make for the human condition in health and disease. Psychiatry is the one branch which realises this diversity the most, but equally important for it is to stress its unity: Of purpose - that of reducing individual and social psychopathology;Of goals - that of unravelling the aetiopathology of psychiatric disorders; finding precision in diagnostics and investigative tests; finding biomarkers; and finding precise therapies for precise disorders that control such disorders; and not just control, but finally cure them; finding methods of primary prevention; of moving from mental disorder to mental health; and, further, of progress to individual actualisation and personal and collective well-being with longevity;Of practice - a) in therapy: By synergising psychopharmacology/somatic therapies with psychotherapy/therapies, social therapies and pharmacogenetics; b) in diagnostics: By identifying the phenotype-genotype-endophenotype axis; and (c) by promoting such therapy and diagnostics as brings about control, and finally, cure/primary prevention of psychiatric disorders.The future course for psychiatry involves a goal oriented forward movement - while allowing for diversity in practice and theory, stressing on unity of purpose, goals, and practice.

        "medline_abstract_text":"Environmental factors substantially influence beginning and progression of mental illness, reinforcing or reducing the consequences of genetic vulnerability. Often initiated by early traumatic events, \"engrams\" or memories are formed that may give rise to a slow and subtle progression of psychiatric disorders. The large delay between beginning and time of onset (diagnosis) may be explained by efficient compensatory mechanisms observed in brain metabolism that use optional pathways in highly redundant molecular interactions. To this end, research has to deal with mechanisms of learning and long-term memory formation, which involves (a) epigenetic changes, (b) altered neuronal activities, and (c) changes in neuron-glia communication. On the epigenetic level, apparently DNA-methylations are more stable than histone modifications, although both closely interact. Neuronal activities basically deliver digital information, which clearly can serve as basis for memory formation (LTP). However, research in this respect has long time neglected the importance of glia. They are more actively involved in the control of neuronal activities than thought before. They can both reinforce and inhibit neuronal activities by transducing neuronal information from frequency-encoded to amplitude and frequency-modulated calcium wave patterns spreading in the glial syncytium by use of gap junctions. In this way, they serve integrative functions. In conclusion, we are dealing with two concepts of encoding information that mutually control each other and synergize: a digital (neuronal) and a wave-like (glial) computing, forming neuron-glia functional units with inbuilt feedback loops to maintain balance of excitation and inhibition. To better understand mental illness, we have to gain more insight into the dynamics of adverse environmental impact on those cellular and molecular systems. This report summarizes existing knowledge and draws some outline about further research in molecular psychiatry. ",

The anculeated platelets are the smallest corpuscular elements circulating in the human blood. They display different serotonergic markers which seem to reflect the central nervous serotonin metabolism. They are known as main effectors in haematological processes but recent research highlights their role in the innate and adaptive immune system. Platelets are containing a multitude of pro-inflammatory and immune-modulatory bioactive compounds in their granules and are expressing immune-competent surface markers. Research gives hint that platelets activation and reactivity is increased by mental stress. This leads to enhanced cross talk with the immune system via paracrine secretion, receptor interaction and formation of platelet leucocyte-aggregates. Recently it has been demonstrated that the immune system can have a remarkable impact in the development of psychiatric disorders. Therefore platelets represent an interesting research area in psychiatry and their role as a possible biomarker has been investigated. We review the influence of mental stress on what is termed platelet bioactivity in this article, which subsumes the mainly immune-modulatory activity of platelets in healthy volunteers, elderly persons with chronic care-giving strain, patients with cardiovascular diseases who are prone to psychosocial stress, as well as in patients with posttraumatic stress disorder. Research data suggest that stress enhances platelet activity, reactivity and immune-modulatory capacities. ",

The interaction between killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) and human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) regulates the activation of natural killer (NK) cells and certain T cell subsets in response to inflammation. The objective of this study was to explore whether KIR gene and HLA-C allele polymorphisms were associated with DED in a Chinese Han population. Polymerase chain reaction with sequence-specific primers method was used to genotype KIR genes and HLA-C alleles in 106 DED patients and 220 healthy controls. Framework genes KIR2DL4, KIR3DL2, KIR3DL3, and KIR3DP1 were present in all individuals. There were no significant differences in the frequencies of inhibitory KIR genes between the two groups. However, the frequency of KIR2DS2 was significantly higher in severe DED patients than that in healthy controls (p=0.031, odds ratio [OR]=1.828, 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.05-3.17). Significantly different distributions of HLA-C allele groups were not observed in severe DED patients and controls. The frequency of the combination of HLA-C1 allele group with KIR2DS2 was significantly higher in severe DED patients compared with controls (p=0.013, OR=2.083, 95% CI=1.16-3.74). These data suggested that this genotype combination was associated with susceptibility to severe DED and that NK cells might have a role in the pathogenesis of DED. The results led to an interesting future research question of whether or not KIR and HLA-C genotypes were involved in the predisposition to or pathogenesis of DED.",

Consistent with this notion, that functioning in the social world is crucial to our survival, while close supportive relationships are known to enhance well-being, a range of social stressors such as abuse, discrimination and dysfunctional relationships can increase the risk of psychiatric disorders. The centrality of the social world to our everyday lives is further exemplified by the fact that abnormality in social behaviour is a salient feature of a range of neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. This paper aims to provide a selective overview of current knowledge of the neurobiological basis of our ability to form and maintain close personal relationships, and of the benefits these relationships confer on our health. Focusing on neurochemical and neuroendocrine interactions within affective and motivational neural circuits, it highlights the specific importance of cutaneous somatosensation in affiliative behaviours and psychological well-being and reviews evidence, in support of the hypothesis, that a class of cutaneous unmyelinated, low threshold mechanosensitive nerves, named c-tactile afferents, have a direct and specific role in processing affiliative tactile stimuli.

There is considerable evidence in the literature to suggest that early interventions and public education can work well for reducing psychiatric morbidity and resulting burden of disease. Educational strategies need to focus on individual, societal and environmental aspects. Targeted interventions at individuals will also need to focus on the whole population. A nested approach with the individual at the heart of it surrounded by family surrounded by society at large is the most suitable way to approach this. This Guidance should be read along with the European Psychiatric Association (EPA) Guidance on Prevention. Those at risk of developing psychiatric disorders also require adequate interventions as well as those who may have already developed illness. However, on the model of triage, mental health and well-being promotion need to be prioritized to ensure that, with the limited resources available, these activities do not get forgotten. One possibility is to have separate programmes for addressing concerns of a particular population group, another that is relevant for the broader general population. Mental health promotion as a concept is important and this will allow prevention of some psychiatric disorders and, by improving coping strategies, is likely to reduce the burden and stress induced by mental illness.",

Antibodies against aminoacyl-tRNA-synthetases are the strongest predictive factors in ILD. In this study, we reviewed the literature and we retrospectively analysed high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) findings in a cohort of 131 consecutive subjects: 75 with polymyositis (PM), 43 with dermatomyositis (DM), one with amyophatic PM, two with paraneoplastic syndromes, and 10 with overlapping syndromes. The inclusion criteria were PM/DM, anti-Jo1 antibody positivity, and HRCT-assessed ILD. The effect of 12 months' treatment with cyclophosphamide (CYC) or cyclosporin A (CsA) plus steroids was assessed by comparing baseline and follow-up HRCT scans for evidence of stability, improvement or worsening. Fifteen patients (11.5%) had ILD and were Jo-1 positive. They were all women with PM, and had a mean age of 47.33 years and a median duration of symptoms of 7.26 months. At baseline, HRCT showed ground-glass attenuations in eight cases, septal thickening in seven, and honeycombing in four. Twelve months after diagnosis, ILD had worsened in nine patients (60%; exact confidence interval [ECI] 32-84) and was stable in four (two patients were lost to follow-up). Seven of the 15 patients were treated with CsA, and 12-month HRCT revealed a worsening in ILD in five cases (71%; ECI 0.29-0.96); ILD also worsened (ECI 16-84) in four of the eight patients treated with CYC pulses (50%). The evolution of the HRCT findings was not significantly different between the two groups. Our findings confirm that ILD is a common early manifestation in patients with Jo1-positive PM. Over twelve months, HRCT showed worsening ILD in most of our patients, with no difference in the HRCT changes between those treated with CYC or CsA.",

Within the hand deformity group, those with mild deformities had lower scores than those with severe deformities. This result was also found in the group of boys but not in the girls.

        "medline_abstract_text":"Well balanced novelty seeking and exploration are fundamental behaviours for survival and are found to be dysfunctional in several psychiatric disorders. Recent studies suggest that the endocannabinoid (eCB) system is an important control system for investigatory drive. Pharmacological treatment of rodents with cannabinergic drugs results in altered social and object investigation. Interestingly, contradictory results have been obtained, depending on the treatment, drug concentration and experimental conditions. The cannabinoid type 1 (CB1) receptor, a central component of the eCB system, is predominantly found at the synapses of two opposing neuronal populations, i.e. on inhibitory GABAergic and excitatory glutamatergic neurons. In the present study, using different transgenic mouse lines, we aimed at investigating the impact of CB1 receptor inactivation in glutamatergic or GABAergic neurons on investigatory behaviour. We evaluated animate (interaction partner) and inanimate (object) exploratory behaviour in three different paradigms. We show that exploration was increased when CB1 receptor was deleted from cortical and striatal GABAergic neurons. No effect was observed when CB1 receptor was deleted specifically from dopamine receptor D1-expressing striatal GABAergic medium spiny neurons. In contrast, deletion of CB1 receptor from cortical glutamatergic neurons resulted in a decreased exploration. Thus, our results indicate that exploratory behaviour is accurately balanced in both, the social and non-social context, by the eCB system via CB1 receptor activation on cortical glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons. In addition, the results could explain the contradictory findings of previous pharmacological studies and could further suggest a possibility to readjust an imbalance in exploratory behaviour observed in psychiatric disorders.",

Previous studies showed great differences in their results: Especially in Germany, many studies compare the heterogeneous group of immigrant children with native children to analyze an ethnic minority or migration process effect. Only a British and Turkish study demonstrates the selection effect in migration. Most Dutch or British studies examined different ethnic groups, e.g. Turkish, Moroccan, Surinamese, Pakistani, Indian or Black migrant children and adolescents. Migrant childhood in Europe could be declared a risk in increasing internalizing problem behavior while the prevalent rate in externalizing problem behavior was comparable between native and migrant children. A migration status itself can often be postulated as a risk factor for children's mental condition, in particular migration in first generation. Furthermore, several major influence factors in migrant children's mental health could be pointed out, such as a low socio-economic status, a Non-European origin, an uncertain cultural identity of the parents, maternal harsh parenting or inadequate parental occupation, a minority status, the younger age, gender effects or a specific culture declaration in diseases.

However, human neurobiological studies are limited. Sex differences in the cerebral metabolic response to an increase in serotonin concentrations were measured, as well as the effect of aging, in men compared to women. Thirty-three normal healthy individuals (14 men/19 women, age range 20-79 years) underwent two resting positron emission tomography studies with the radiotracer [18F]-2-deoxy-2-fluoro-D-glucose ([(18)F]-FDG) after placebo and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI, citalopram) infusions on two separate days. Results indicated that women demonstrated widespread areas of increased cortical glucose metabolism with fewer areas of decrease in metabolism in response to citalopram. Men, in contrast, demonstrated several regions of decreased cortical metabolism, but no regions of increased metabolism. Age was associated with greater increases in women and greater decreases in men in most brain regions. These results support prior studies indicating that serotonin function differs in men and women across the lifespan. Future studies aimed at characterizing the influences of age and sex on the serotonin system in patients with psychiatric disorders are needed to elucidate the relationship between sex and age differences in brain chemistry and associated differences in symptom presentation and treatment response.",

The CRF system has a heterogeneous role in SUDs. It enhances the acute effects of drugs of abuse and is also responsible for the potentiation of drug-induced neuroplasticity evoked during the withdrawal period. We present in this review the brain regions and circuitries where CRF is expressed and may participate in stress-induced drug abuse.

The covalent adduction of nucleophilic amino acid side-chains by lipid electrophiles is significantly increased in patients with alcoholic liver disease (ALD); a global assessment of in vivo protein targets and the consequences of these modifications, however, has not been conducted. In this article, we describe the identification of novel protein targets for covalent adduction in a 6-week murine model for ALD. Ethanol-fed mice displayed a 2-fold increase in hepatic TBARS, while immunohistochemical analysis for the reactive aldehydes 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), 4-oxononenal (4-ONE), acrolein (ACR), and malondialdehyde (MDA) revealed a marked increase in the staining of modified proteins in the ethanol-treated mice. Increased protein carbonyl content was confirmed utilizing subcellular fractionation of liver homogenates followed by biotin-tagging through hydrazide chemistry, where approximately a 2-fold increase in modified proteins was observed in microsomal and cytosolic fractions. To determine targets of protein carbonylation, a secondary hydrazide method coupled to a highly sensitive 2-dimensional liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (2D LC-MS/MS or MuDPIT) technique was utilized. Our results have identified 414 protein targets for modification by reactive aldehydes in ALD. The presence of novel in vivo sites of protein modification by 4-HNE (2), 4-ONE (4) and ACR (2) was also confirmed in our data set. While the precise impact of protein carbonylation in ALD remains unknown, a bioinformatic analysis of the data set has revealed key pathways associated with disease progression, including fatty acid metabolism, drug metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation, and the TCA cycle. These data suggest a major role for aldehyde adduction in the pathogenesis of ALD.",

In the context of cystic fibrosis (CF), a genetic disease caused by a defective CFTR gene (e.g. ΔF508-CFTR), it was assumed that sildenafil could be a promising substance to correct impaired protein expression. This study focuses on the molecular mechanisms of sildenafil on CFTR recovery. We used ΔF508-CFTR/wt-CFTR expressing Xenopus laevis oocytes and human bronchial epithelial cell lines (CFBE41o(-)/16HBE14o(-)) to investigate the pathways of sildenafil action. Cells were treated with sildenafil and cAMP-mediated current (I(m)), conductance (G(m)), and capacitance (C(m)) were determined. Sildenafil increased I(m), G(m), and C(m) of wt-CFTR and functionally restored ΔF508-CFTR in oocytes. These effects were also seen in CFBE41o(-) and 16HBE14o(-) cells. Transepithelial measurements revealed that sildenafil mediated increase (wt-CFTR) and restoration (ΔF508-CFTR) of channel activity. cGMP pathway blocker inhibited the activity increase but not CFTR/ΔF508-CFTR exocytosis. From these data we conclude that sildenafil mediates potentiation of CFTR activity by a cGMP-dependent and initiates cGMP-independent functional insertion of CFTR/ΔF508-CFTR molecules into the apical membranes. Thus, sildenafil is a corrector and potentiator of CFTR/ΔF508-CFTR. Yet, the necessary high doses of the drug for CFTR recovery demonstrate that sildenafil might not be suited as a therapeutic drug for CF lung disease.",

Using diffusion weighted (DWI) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), WM fiber pathways between brain regions may be systematically assessed to make inferences concerning their role in normal brain function, influence on behavior, as well as concerning the consequences of network-level brain damage. In this paper, we investigate the detailed connectomics in a noted example of severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) which has proved important to and controversial in the history of neuroscience. We model the WM damage in the notable case of Phineas P. Gage, in whom a \"tamping iron\" was accidentally shot through his skull and brain, resulting in profound behavioral changes. The specific effects of this injury on Mr. Gage's WM connectivity have not previously been considered in detail. Using computed tomography (CT) image data of the Gage skull in conjunction with modern anatomical MRI and diffusion imaging data obtained in contemporary right handed male subjects (aged 25-36), we computationally simulate the passage of the iron through the skull on the basis of reported and observed skull fiducial landmarks and assess the extent of cortical gray matter (GM) and WM damage. Specifically, we find that while considerable damage was, indeed, localized to the left frontal cortex, the impact on measures of network connectedness between directly affected and other brain areas was profound, widespread, and a probable contributor to both the reported acute as well as long-term behavioral changes. Yet, while significantly affecting several likely network hubs, damage to Mr. Gage's WM network may not have been more severe than expected from that of a similarly sized \"average\" brain lesion. These results provide new insight into the remarkable brain injury experienced by this noteworthy patient.",

Coagulation factor inhibitors can develop against any coagulation factor, although the most common are against factor VIII (FVIII). These can develop in individuals with inherited haemophilia A (HA) as an immune response to factor replacement therapy, or as auto-antibodies leading to the condition of acquired HA. Clinical suspicion for inhibitors may arise when individuals present with bleeding symptoms without any prior bleeding diathesis, or when a patient with known mild haemophilia presents with a bleeding diathesis more extreme to their usual presentation, or when there is failure of factor replacement therapy to arrest bleeding in a known haemophiliac. The laboratory identification of factor inhibitors requires a careful and systematic approach that excludes other possible causes of prolonged screening tests, most commonly the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), and sometimes prothrombin time (PT). Coagulation factor inhibitor studies, including the Bethesda assay, are then undertaken to measure inhibitor titre, which guides treatment. This paper overviews the laboratory investigation of factor inhibitors, and also briefly reviews recent cross-laboratory inhibitor studies and the most recent evidence related to differential inhibitor formation according to type of therapy.",

In this study, we determined whether IN DFO also has beneficial effects in the P301L mouse, which accumulates hyperphosphorylated tau. Mice were intranasally treated three times per week with either 10% DFO (2.4 mg) or saline for 5 months, and a battery of behavioral tests were conducted before tissue collection and biochemical analyses of brain tissue with Western blot and ELISA. Wild-type (WT) mice statistically outperformed transgenic (TG) saline mice in the radial arm water maze, while performance of TG-DFO mice was not different than WT mice, suggesting improved performance in the radial arm water maze. Other behavioral changes were not evident. Beneficial changes in brain biochemistry were evident in DFO-treated mice for several proteins. The TG mice had significantly less pGSK3β and HIF-1α, with more interleukin-1β and total protein oxidation than wild-type controls, and for each protein, DFO treatment significantly reduced these differences. There was not a significant decrease in phosphorylated tau in brain tissue of DFO-treated mice at the sites we measured. These data suggest that IN DFO is a potential treatment not only for Alzheimer's disease, but also for other neurodegenerative diseases and psychiatric disorders in which GSK3β and HIF-1α play a prominent role.",

The psychometric properties of the questionnaire were examined using multidimensional item response theory (MIRT). Norm references were also calculated. Five items were found to distort ability estimates (Differential item functioning; DIF). MIRT analyses were subsequently carried out for the remaining 25 items. Almost all items showed good discrimination and difficulty parameters based on the fitted model. Two stable dimensions with 21 items were retrieved for which norm references for the Dutch and North American, dialysis and transplantation groups were calculated.

Gene mutations associated familial Parkinson's disease give rise to mitochondrial changes, altered energy homeostasis and intracellular trafficking deficits, and these can be modeled in transgenic mice. Here we discuss the recent finding of prodromal behavioral disturbances in a PINK1 deficient mouse that manifest prior to dopaminergic cell death and correlate to 5-HT fiber losses and mitochondrial morphological changes. We discuss the representation of the PINK1 deficient mouse and other genetic models to accurately recapitulate early Parkinson's disease.

The SB calculation estimates the difference after stratification for risk categories between the survival rate of transplanted versus waiting list patients. The aim of this study was to perform a short- and long-term (60 months) SB analyses of a Italian OLT program. One-hundred seventy-one patients were stratified into four MELD classes (6-14, 15-18, 19-25, 26-40), and two groups: namely, waiting list (WL) and transplanted groups (TX). The median waiting time for transplanted patients was 4.4 months (range, 0-35). SB was expressed as mortality hazard ratio (MHR) as obtained through a Cox regression analysis using as a covariate the status of each patient in the waiting list (WL = 0, reference group) or the TX group (TX = 1). Values over 1 indicated the MHR in favor of the WL with the values below 1 indicating MHR in favor of Tx. In the MELD class 6 to 14, the MHR was above 1 at 3 and 6 months, indicating an SB in favor of WL; subsequently, the MHR dropped below 1, indicating an SB in favor of TX (P < .05). In the MELD class 15 to 18 the MHR was above 1 at 3 months, but below 1 subsequently (P < .05). For MELD classes 19 to 25 and 26 to 40, the MHR was always below 1 (P < .01). According to the SB approach, patients in the MELD class 6 to 14 could safely wait for at least 36 months; patients in the MELD class 15 to 18 should likely remain no longer than 12 months on the waiting list, and all the remaining patients with MELD > 18 should be transplanted as soon as possible. OLT should not be precluded but only postponed for MELD < 19 patients.",

The objective is to determine the impact of MELD and kidney function on all-cause mortality. Among LTs performed in a tertiary referral hospital between 1995 and 2009, 419 cases were studied. Cox proportional hazards models were constructed to estimate the hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for death. Over mean follow-ups of 8.4 and 3.1 years during the pre-MELD and MELD era, 57 and 63 deaths were observed, respectively. Those transplanted during the MELD era had a higher likelihood of hepatorenal syndrome (8% vs 2%, P < 0.01), lower kidney function (median estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] 77.8 vs 92.6 mL/ min/1.73 m(2), P < 0.01), and more pretransplantation renal replacement therapy (RRT) (5% vs 1%; P < 0.01). All-cause mortality risk was similar in the MELD vs the pre-MELD era (HR: 0.98, 95% CI: 0.58-1.65). The risk of death, however, was nearly 3-fold greater (95% CI: 1.14-6.60) among those requiring pre- transplant RRT. Similarly, eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) post-transplant was associated with a 2.5-fold higher mortality (95% CI: 1.48-4.11). The study suggests that MELD implementation had no impact on all-cause mortality post-LT. However, the need for pre-transplant RRT and post-transplant kidney dysfunction was associated with a more than 2-fold greater risk of subsequent death.",

The survey was carried out through a Web-based questionnaire that participants could fill in online between March and December 2010. The data were validated against those of the Italian Dialysis and Transplant Registry (RIDT) and therefore refer to 31 December 2008, the date of the last RIDT report. Accurate completion of the questionnaires and reminders were monitored by the presidents of the regional sections of the SIN and the regional registries' chairpersons under the coordination of four area managers and a census committee. The response to the survey represented 42% of all nephrology centers, treating about 50% of all dialysis patients in Italy. The response percentage varied widely among regions (from 5% to 100% of the centers). After exclusion of the three regions with responses below 10%, it reached 68%, which was sufficient to give an idea of the state of nephrology in Italy. However, due to this wide variability, it was not possible to make an overall comparison of the regional situations, hence data for complex and simple structures were assessed separately. Despite the limits due to the incomplete participation in the survey, this article provides a clear description of the state of nephrology in Italy. The results confirm the hypothesis presented in the work of Bocconi Cergas, namely that the nephrology market is broader than nephrologists are able to control. The work of the nephrologist, which still seems to be focused mainly on dialysis in its various forms, should be directed more towards the development of methods for early detection of kidney disease and close follow-up. The ultimate aim is the early diagnosis of kidney disease and hence prevention of its complications, so that the focus no longer needs to be on ESKD treatment systems.",

While dry eye patients are known to have an increased risk of corneal infection, it is not known whether there is a direct causal relationship between these two conditions. Here, we tested the hypothesis that experimentally-induced dry eye (EDE) increases susceptibility to corneal infection using a mouse model. In doing so, we also examined the role of surfactant protein D (SP-D), which we have previously shown is involved in corneal defense against infection. Scopolamine injections and fan-driven air were used to cause EDE in C57BL/6 or Black Swiss mice (wild-type and SP-D gene-knockout). Controls received PBS injections and were housed normally. After 5 or 10 days, otherwise uninjured corneas were inoculated with 10(9) cfu of Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain PAO1. Anesthesia was maintained for 3 h post-inoculation. Viable bacteria were quantified in ocular surface washes and corneal homogenates 6 h post-inoculation. SP-D was measured by Western immunoblot, and corneal pathology assessed from 6 h to 4 days. EDE mice showed reduced tear volumes after 5 and 10 days (each by ∼75%, p<0.001) and showed fluorescein staining (i.e. epithelial disruption). Surprisingly, there was no significant difference in corneal pathology between EDE mice and controls (∼10-14% incidence). Before bacterial inoculation, EDE mice showed elevated SP-D in ocular washes. After inoculation, fewer bacteria were recovered from ocular washes of EDE mice (<2% of controls, p = 0.0004). Furthermore, SP-D knockout mice showed a significant increase in P. aeruginosa corneal colonization under EDE conditions. Taken together, these data suggest that SP-D contributes to corneal defense against P. aeruginosa colonization and infection in EDE despite the loss of barrier function to fluorescein.",

Infants are affected differently than adults due to drastic immaturities, both physiologically and immunologically, and it is becoming apparent that they represent a critically understudied population. Highlighting our work funded by the ONES award, in this review we argue the understated importance of utilizing infant models to truly understand the etiology of PM-induced predisposition to severe, persistent lung disease. We also touch upon various mechanisms of PM-mediated respiratory damage, with a focus on the emerging importance of environmentally persistent free radicals (EPFRs) ubiquitously present in combustion-derived PM.

Brain trauma, neurodegenerative diseases, and psychiatric disorders pose enormous burdens at both personal and societal levels. Although medications for these disorders are widely used, the treatment mechanisms underlying the illnesses remain largely elusive. In the past decade, an increasing amount of evidence indicate that adult neurogenesis (i.e. generating new CNS neurons during adulthood) may be involved in the pathology of different CNS disorders, and thus neurogenesis may be a potential target area for treatments. Although new neurons were shown to be a major player in mediating treatment efficacy of neurological and psychotropic drugs on cognitive functions, it is still debatable if the altered production of new neurons can cause the disorders. This review hence seeks to discuss pre and current clinical studies that demonstrate the functional impact adult neurogenesis have on neurological and psychiatric illnesses while examining the related underlying disease mechanisms.

However, family-level measurement of inter-parental conflict in most traditional child twin studies has made it difficult to tease apart the specific causal mechanisms underlying this association. The Children's Perception of Inter-parental Conflict scale (CPIC) provides a child-specific measurement tool for examining these questions, as its subscales tap multiple dimensions of conflict assessed from the child's (rather than the parent's) perspective. The current study examined (1) the degree of genetic and environmental influence on each of the CPIC subscales, and (2) etiological contributions to the covariation between the CPIC scales and parental reports of child behavioral problems. The CPIC was completed by 1,200 child twins (aged 6-11 years) from the Michigan State University Twin Registry (MSUTR). Parents completed the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) to assess child internalizing and externalizing behavior problems. Multivariate models were examined to evaluate the relative contributions of genetic and environmental factors to both the CPIC scales and to their overlap with child behavioral outcomes. Modeling results indicated no significant moderation of sex or age. Significant environmental overlap emerged between the CPIC conflict properties scale and child internalizing and externalizing problems. By contrast, significant genetic correlations emerged between the CPIC self-blame scale and externalizing problems as well as between the CPIC threat scale and internalizing problems. Overall, findings suggest that the subscales of the CPIC are somewhat etiologically diverse and may provide a useful tool for future investigations of possible gene-environment interplay.",

This study aimed to estimate the prevalence and types of ocular pathology, and explore risk factors potentially associated with disease within a population of working horses in Ethiopia. In total, 1049 horses were selected from horses attending clinics run by the Society for Protection of Animals Abroad (SPANA). Each had an ophthalmic examination conducted under field conditions using a pen-torch. All owners completed a short questionnaire. The prevalence of ocular abnormalities was 23.5 per cent (95 per cent confidence interval (CI) 18.0 per cent to 30.1 per cent) and the percentage of horses with an abnormality in at least one eye was 43 per cent (95 per cent CI 28.7 per cent to 58.4 per cent), although this varied between towns. Mild eye pathology and end-stage disease with irreversible pathology were most common. There were significantly more eye abnormalities in the right eye compared with the left, and older horses were more likely to have ocular pathology. Only 55.1 per cent of owners had noticed there was an ocular abnormality present, and only 2.2 per cent had received any previous treatment for eye disease. Only 1.9 per cent presented to the clinic because of an eye problem. There appears to be either a lack of owner awareness, or a low perception of the importance of eye disease among owners.",

The             total RNA of liver tissues was extracted from four groups of patients, ten subjects             each. Microarrays were utilized to detect differentially expressed genes and microRNAs.             According to gene values, significance levels and false discovery rate with a             random variance model, gene ontology (GO) and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes             and Genomes (KEGG) database, node genes and key microRNAs in networks were obtained             and analyzed. A total of 878 differentially expressed genes and 26 microRNAs were             found. In co-expression genetic networks, node genes modulating the network were             Acyl-coenzyme A synthetase-3 (ACSF3), Frizzled-5 (FZD5), LOC727987 and C1orf222.             In microRNA-gene networks, the key microRNAs were hsa-miR-570, hsa-miR-122, hsa-miR-34b,             hsa-miR-29c, hsa-miR-922 and hsa-miR-185, which negatively regulated approximately             79 downstream target genes. In the course of ALD, we found 4 differentially expressed             node genes and analyzed ACSF3 and FZD5. ACSF3 was significantly upregulated, and             was involved in fatty acid and lipid metabolism and accelerated liver injury.             These two genes were involved in fatty acids and lipid metabolism. FZD5 was downregulated             and reduced the synthesis of membrane transport protein in the hepatic membrane             and the membrane stability, and accelerated the liver cell apoptosis process.             Six key microRNAs regulated numerous biological functions such as the immune response,             the inflammatory response and glutathione metabolism.

The underlying mechanisms are largely unknown, but they are distinct from those related to gastric injury. Based on recent insights from experimental models, including genetics and pharmacology in rodents typically exposed to diclofenac, indomethacin, or naproxen, we propose a multiple-hit pathogenesis of NSAID enteropathy. The multiple hits start with an initial pharmacokinetic determinant caused by vectorial hepatobiliary excretion and delivery of glucuronidated NSAID or oxidative metabolite conjugates to the distal small intestinal lumen, where bacterial β-glucuronidase produces critical aglycones. The released aglycones are then taken up by enterocytes and further metabolized by intestinal cytochrome P450s to potentially reactive intermediates. The \"first hit\" is caused by the NSAID and/or oxidative metabolites that induce severe endoplasmic reticulum stress or mitochondrial stress and lead to cell death. The \"second hit\" is created by the significant subsequent inflammatory response that would follow such a first-hit injury. Based on these putative mechanisms, strategies have been developed to protect the enterocytes from being exposed to the parent NSAID and/or oxidative metabolites. Among these, a novel strategy already demonstrated in a murine model is the selective disruption of bacteria-specific β-glucuronidases with a novel small molecule inhibitor that does not harm the bacteria and that alleviates NSAID-induced enteropathy. Such mechanism-based strategies require further investigation but provide potential avenues for the alleviation of the GI toxicity caused by multiple NSAID hits.",

The percentage of high molecular weight multimers (%HMWMs) was significantly elevated in the ESKD patients compared with controls. TSP-1 was lower and IL-6 was higher providing possible explanation for the increase in %HMWM in ESKD. The %HMWM dropped significantly in the postdialysis sample. Mortality at 4 years was significantly associated with vWF : Ag. There are higher plasma vWF : Ag levels and a small increase in HMWMs in the ESKD milieu. The acute drop in the %HMWM of vWF postdialysis appears to be due to shear forces encountered during the dialysis procedure.

Historically investigators have had to use invasive techniques such as histological examination of excised tissue to study airway wall structure. The last several years has seen a proliferation of relatively noninvasive techniques to assess the airway branching pattern, wall thickness, and more recently, airway wall tissue components. These methods include computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and optical coherence tomography. These new imaging technologies have become popular because to understand the physiology of lung disease it is important we understand the underlying anatomy. However, these new approaches are not standardized or available in all centers so a review of their validity and clinical utility is appropriate. This review documents how investigators are working hard to correct for inconsistencies between techniques so that they become more accepted and utilized in clinical settings. These new imaging techniques are very likely to play a frontline role in the study of lung disease and will, hopefully, allow clinicians and investigators to better understand disease pathogenesis and to design and assess new therapeutic interventions.",

However, the combined effect of physiological concentrations of alcohol and iron on oxidative stress in hepatocytes remains unknown. Baicalin has been demonstrated to be an antioxidant or iron chelator in animal experiments. In this study, we investigated the injury to hepatocytes CYP2E1-independently induced by the combination of alcohol and iron and the protective effect of baicalin. Compared with cells treated with ethanol alone, ferric citrate enhanced the accumulation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, increased the occurrence of protein carbonylation/nitration and the levels of 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal, changed the distribution of iNOS, and eventually resulted in apoptosis. However, pretreatment with baicalin inhibited the oxidative stress induced by the combination of alcohol and iron, mainly by chelating iron. Our findings therefore suggest that iron could CPY2E1-independently enhance the oxidative stress induced by alcohol, which probably contributes to the pathogenesis of alcoholic liver disease.

Methods. Seven to 8-week-old female C57BL/6 mice were housed in a controlled environment chamber and administered scopolamine to induce experimental DED. Mice received intravenous TLR4 inhibitor (Eritoran) to block systemic TLR4-mediated activity. The expression of TLR4 by the corneal epithelium and stroma was evaluated using real-time polymerase chain reaction and flow cytometry. Corneal fluorescein staining (CFS) was performed to evaluate clinical disease severity. The corneal expression of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF, and CCL2), corneal infiltration of CD11b(+) antigen-presenting cells, and lymph node frequency of mature MHC-II(hi) CD11b(+) cells were assessed.  Results. The epithelial cells of normal corneas expressed TLR4 intracellularly; however, DED significantly increased the cell surface expression of TLR4. Similarly, flow cytometric analysis of stromal cells revealed a significant increase in the expression of TLR4 proteins by DED-induced corneas as compared with normal corneas. DED increased the mRNA expression of TLR4 in corneal stromal cells, but not epithelial cells. TLR4 inhibition decreased the severity of CFS and significantly reduced the mRNA expression of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF. Furthermore, TLR4 inhibition significantly reduced the corneal infiltration of CD11b(+) cells and the lymph node frequency of MHC-II(hi) CD11b(+) cells.  Conclusions. These results suggest that DED increases the corneal expression of TLR4 and that TLR4 participates in the inflammatory response to ocular surface desiccating stress.",

        "medline_abstract_text":"Mitochondrial protein acetylation increases in response to chronic ethanol ingestion in mice, and is thought to reduce mitochondrial function and contribute to the pathogenesis of alcoholic liver disease. The mitochondrial deacetylase SIRT3 regulates the acetylation status of several mitochondrial proteins, including those involved in ethanol metabolism. The newly discovered desuccinylase activity of the mitochondrial sirtuin SIRT5 suggests that protein succinylation could be an important post-translational modification regulating mitochondrial metabolism. To assess the possible role of protein succinylation in ethanol metabolism, we surveyed hepatic sub-cellular protein fractions from mice fed a control or ethanol-supplemented diet for succinyl-lysine, as well as acetyl-, propionyl-, and butyryl-lysine post-translational modifications. We found mitochondrial protein propionylation increases, similar to mitochondrial protein acetylation. In contrast, mitochondrial protein succinylation is reduced. These mitochondrial protein modifications appear to be primarily driven by ethanol metabolism, and not by changes in mitochondrial sirtuin levels. Similar trends in acyl modifications were observed in the nucleus. However, comparatively fewer acyl modifications were observed in the cytoplasmic or the microsomal compartments, and were generally unchanged by ethanol metabolism. Using a mass spectrometry proteomics approach, we identified several candidate acetylated, propionylated, and succinylated proteins, which were enriched using antibodies against each modification. Additionally, we identified several acetyl and propionyl lysine residues on the same sites for a number of proteins and supports the idea of the overlapping nature of lysine-specific acylation. Thus, we show that novel post-translational modifications are present in hepatic mitochondrial, nuclear, cytoplasmic, and microsomal compartments and ethanol ingestion, and its associated metabolism, induce specific changes in these acyl modifications. These data suggest that protein acylation, beyond protein acetylation, contributes to the overall metabolic regulatory network and could play an important role in the pathogenesis of alcoholic liver disease.

This is a preliminary step toward developing a rabbit infection model for studying pathogenesis and therapy of EPE in horses. Nine does were equally assigned to 3 groups. Animals in 2 groups (Group 1 and Group 2) were orally inoculated with different doses of cell-cultured L. intracellularis. Controls (Group 3) were sham-inoculated. Feces and blood were collected before the rabbits were infected and at 7, 14, and 21 days post-infection (DPI). Serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) titers were measured using an immunoperoxidase monolayer assay (IPMA) and fecal samples were analyzed with quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). A doe from each group was euthanized at 7, 14, and 21 DPI for collection and evaluation of intestinal samples. Tissues were stained by routine hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) method and immunohistochemistry (IHC) with L. intracellularis-specific mouse monoclonal antibody. At 14 DPI, serologic responses were detected in both infected groups, which maintained high titers through to 21 DPI. Lawsonia intracellularis DNA was detected in the feces of Group 2 on 7 DPI and in both infected groups on 14 DPI. Gross lesions were apparent in Group 1 and Group 2 on 14 DPI. Immunohistochemistry confirmed L. intracellularis antigen within cells of rabbits in Group 1 and Group 2 on 7, 14, and 21 DPI. No lesions, serologic response, shedding, or IHC labeling were found in Group 3 rabbits.

Adiponectin, an adipokine predominantly secreted from adipose tissue, has been shown to play beneficial roles in alcoholic liver disease against various inflammatory and pro-apoptotic molecules. However, the effects of adiponectin on ethanol-induced apoptosis in liver cells are largely unknown. Herein, we investigated the role of globular adiponectin (gAcrp) in the prevention of ethanol-induced apoptosis and further tried to decipher the potential mechanisms involved. In the present study, we demonstrated that gAcrp significantly inhibits both ethanol-induced increase in Fas ligand expression and activation of caspase-3 in human hepatoma cell lines (HepG2 cells), suggesting that gAcrp plays a protective role against ethanol-induced apoptosis in liver cells. This protective effect of gAcrp was mediated through adiponectin receptor R1 (adipoR1). Further, globular adiponectin treatment caused induction of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) through, at least in part, nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2, (Nrf2) signaling. Treatment with SnPP, a pharmacological inhibitor of HO-1, and knockdown of HO-1 with small interfering RNA (siRNA) restored caspase-3 activity suppressed by gAcrp, indicating a critical role of HO-1 in mediating the protective role of gAcrp in ethanol-induced apoptosis in liver cells. In addition, carbon monoxide, a byproduct obtained from the catabolism of free heme was found to contribute to the anti-apoptotic effect of adiponectin. In conclusion, these data demonstrated that globular adiponectin prevents ethanol-induced apoptosis in HepG2 cells via HO-1 induction and revealed a novel biological response of globular adiponectin in the protection of liver injury from alcohol consumption.",

        "medline_abstract_text":"The production of reactive aldehydes including 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE) is a key component of the pathogenesis in a spectrum of chronic inflammatory hepatic diseases including alcoholic liver disease (ALD). One consequence of ALD is increased oxidative stress and altered β-oxidation in hepatocytes. A major regulator of β-oxidation is 5' AMP protein kinase (AMPK). In an in vitro cellular model, we identified AMPK as a direct target of 4-HNE adduction resulting in inhibition of both H2O2 and 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxyamide ribonucleoside (AICAR)-induced downstream signaling. By employing biotin hydrazide capture, it was confirmed that 4-HNE treatment of cells resulted in carbonylation of AMPKα/β, which was not observed in untreated cells. Using a murine model of alcoholic liver disease, treatment with high concentrations of ethanol resulted in an increase in phosphorylated as well as carbonylated AMPKα. Despite increased AMPK phosphorylation, there was no significant change in phosphorylation of acetyl CoA carboxylase. Mass spectrometry identified Michael addition adducts of 4-HNE on Cys(130), Cys(174), Cys(227), and Cys(304) on recombinant AMPKα and Cys(225) on recombinant AMPKβ. Molecular modeling analysis of identified 4-HNE adducts on AMPKα suggest that inhibition of AMPK occurs by steric hindrance of the active site pocket and by inhibition of hydrogen peroxide induced oxidation. The observed inhibition of AMPK by 4-HNE provides a novel mechanism for altered β-oxidation in ALD, and these data demonstrate for the first time that AMPK is subject to regulation by reactive aldehydes in vivo.

Furthermore, effectiveness of individual cellular therapies to correct gas exchange and provide other critical lung functions remains unproven. Finally, feasibility of autologous whole organ replacement has not been confirmed as a durable therapy. Growing points Cellular therapies for lung regeneration would be enhanced by better lineage tracing within the lung, the ability to direct differentiation of exogenous stem or progenitor cells, and the development of functional assays for cellular viability and regenerative properties. Whether endogenous or exogeneous cells will ultimately play a greater therapeutic role remains to be seen. Reducing the need for lung replacement via endogenous cell-mediated repair is a key goal. Thereafter, improving the potential of donor lungs in transplant recipients is a further area where cell-based therapies may be beneficial. Ultimately, lung replacement with autologous tissue-engineered lungs is another goal for cell-based therapy. Areas timely for developing research Defining 'lung stem or progenitor cell' populations in both animal models and human tissue may help. Additionally, standardizing assays for assessing the potential of endogenous or exogenous cells within the lung is important. Understanding cell-matrix interactions in real time and with biomechanical insight will be central for lung engineering.

As exposure-related lung diseases continue to be identified, advances in exposure biology have introduced toxicogenomic approaches that detect biomarkers of exposure at the gene, protein, and metabolite levels. Moreover, genetic epidemiology research has focused more recently on common, low-penetrant (ie, low-relative-risk) genetic variants that may interact with commonly encountered exposures. A number of such gene by environment interactions have been identified for airways and interstitial lung diseases, with the goal of preventing disease among susceptible populations that may not otherwise have been identified. Exhaled breath condensate analysis has provided another noninvasive means of assessing toxicant exposures and systemic effects. As these technologies become more refined, clinicians and public health practitioners will need to appreciate the social implications of the individual- and population-level risks conferred by certain genetic polymorphisms or by biomarker evidence of exposure. At present, the primary approach to occupational and environmental lung disease prevention remains elimination or reduction of known hazardous exposures and requires continued application of local and international resources toward exposure control.",

The objective of this study was to create an algorithm, or models, based on the most significant LOS predictors as identified from national data at different stages of the transplant process. Four models were developed predicting LOS using recipient factors, payment factors, donor factors, and postoperative factors. A medical care team member can enter a patient's data into the model and receive a reasonably accurate prediction of LOS for each phase of the liver transplant process, specifying the impact of each factor. These predictions would help predict the factors most likely to prolong LOS, inform resource allocation, and provide patients with more specific predictions of their LOS following transplantation. ",

Our newly-developed e-learning program uses a cell phone Internet connection service to support pregnant women who want to quit smoking. Using this, service participants were given guidance concerning smoking, and were breath tested for their carbon monoxide levels every 4 weeks for 3 months.

        "medline_abstract_text":"The present study was designed to investigate the ameliorative role of cilnidipine and nimodipine in immobilization stress-induced behavioral alterations and memory defects in the mice. Acute stress was induced by immobilizing the mice for 150 min and stress-induced behavioral changes were assessed using actophotometer, hole board, open field and social interaction tests. The learning and memory was evaluated using elevated plus maze tests and biochemically, the corticosterone levels were measured in the blood serum. Acute immobilization stress resulted in decrease in locomotor activity, frequency of head dips and rearings in hole board; line crossing and rearing in the open field; increase in avoidance in social behavior along with development of memory deficits assessed by an increased transfer latency time and elevation of the corticosterone levels. Administration of cilnidipine (10 mg/kg), an L and N-type dual calcium channel blocker, and nimodipine (10 mg/kg), an L-type calcium channel blocker, significantly attenuated the immobilized stress-induced behavioral changes and restored memory deficits along with normalization of the corticosterone levels. Cilnidipine and nimodipine produced comparable beneficial effects in restoring immobilization stress subjected mice. It may be concluded that cilnidipine and nimodipine mediated attenuation of corticosterone release by blockage of calcium channels (both L and N-type) on the HPA-axis is responsible for beneficial effects in restoration of behavioral alterations and memory deficits in immobilization-induced acute stress in mice.",

Outcomes following lung transplantation have improved in the recent era with a 5-year survival of > 70% and an overall good functional status of surviving recipients. Many of the advances have been achieved by the use of modern immunosuppressive agents. To date, multiple strategies exist that may be employed when utilizing immunosuppression. These agents can be used in a variety of roles that may include induction, maintenance or rescue therapy, many of which are illustrated in this review including the current evidence to support their use. Infections in lung transplant recipients remain a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Special considerations are required with the substantial burden of chronic infection in candidates with CF lung disease before transplantation, which are discussed. Furthermore, recent progress and advances in prevention and treatment of post-transplantation infectious complications are detailed. Chronic lung allograft dysfunction remains to be the burden of lung transplantation in the long-term. Unfortunately, there is no well-established therapy to address it. However, therapy attempts include change/augmentation of immunosupression, use of neomacrolides and extracorporeal photopheresis, all of which are reviewed in detail.",

        "medline_abstract_text":"Celiac disease (CD) is an enteropathy caused by the ingestion of wheat gluten in genetically susceptible individuals. A complete understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms in CD has been hindered because of the lack of adequate in vivo models. In the present study, we explored the events after the intragastric administration of gliadin and of the albumin/globulin fraction from wheat in human leukocyte antigen-DQ8 transgenic mice (DQ8 mice) treated with indomethacin, an inhibitor of cyclooxygenases (COXs). After 10 days of treatment, mice showed a significant reduction of villus height, increased crypt depth, increased number of lamina propria-activated macrophages, and high basal interferon-γ secretion in mesenteric lymph nodes, all of which were specifically related to gliadin intake, whereas the albumin/globulin fraction of wheat was unable to induce similar changes. Cotreatment with NS-398, a specific inhibitor of COX-2, also induced the intestinal lesion. Enteropathy onset was further characterized by high levels of oxidative stress markers, similar to CD. Biochemical assessment of the small intestine revealed the specific activation of matrix metalloproteinases 2 and 9, high caspase-3 activity, and a significant increase of tissue transglutaminase protein levels associated with the intestinal lesion. Notably, after 30 days of treatment, enteropathic mice developed serum antibodies toward gliadin (IgA) and tissue transglutaminase (IgG). We concluded that gliadin intake in combination with COX inhibition caused a basal inflammatory status and an oxidative stress condition in the small intestine of DQ8 mice, thus triggering the mucosal lesion and, subsequently, an antigen-specific immunity.

The objective of this study was to determine if alcohol alters hepatic zinc transporters in association with reduction of hepatic zinc levels and if oxidative stress mediates the alterations of zinc transporters. C57BL/6 mice were pair-fed with the Lieber-DeCarli control or ethanol diets for 2, 4, or 8 wk. Chronic alcohol exposure reduced hepatic zinc levels, but increased plasma and urine zinc levels, at all time points. Hepatic zinc finger proteins, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPAR-α) and hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF-4α), were downregulated in ethanol-fed mice. Four hepatic zinc transporter proteins showed significant alterations in ethanol-fed mice compared with the controls. ZIP5 and ZIP14 proteins were downregulated, while ZIP7 and ZnT7 proteins were upregulated, by ethanol exposure at all time points. Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated that chronic ethanol exposure upregulated cytochrome P-450 2E1 and caused 4-hydroxynonenal accumulation in the liver. For the in vitro study, murine FL-83B hepatocytes were treated with 5 μM 4-hydroxynonenal or 100 μM hydrogen peroxide for 72 h. The results from in vitro studies demonstrated that 4-hydroxynonenal treatment altered ZIP5 and ZIP7 protein abundance, and hydrogen peroxide treatment changed ZIP7, ZIP14, and ZnT7 protein abundance. These results suggest that chronic ethanol exposure alters hepatic zinc transporters via oxidative stress, which might account for ethanol-induced hepatic zinc deficiency. ",

The Medicare costs for persons who have stage 1 kidney disease were not significantly different from zero. Per person annual Medicare expenses attributable to CKD were $1700 for stage 2, $3500 for stage 3, and $12,700 for stage 4, adjusted to 2010 dollars.

The procurement of DCDD livers is actively promoted as a means of increasing the donor pool and bridging the evolving disparity between the wait-list length and the number of transplants performed. The objective of this retrospective study of a cohort of patients who were matched for age, liver disease etiology, and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score was to determine whether differences in perioperative costs and resource utilization are associated with the use of such organs. Our results showed an increased prevalence of reperfusion syndrome in the DCDD cohort (P < 0.001), a prolonged heparin effect (P = 0.01), a greater incidence of hyperfibrinolysis (P = 0.002), longer periods of postoperative ventilator use (P = 0.03) and vasopressor support (P = 0.002), and a prolonged length of stay in the intensive therapy unit (ITU; P = 0.02). The peak posttransplant aspartate aminotransferase level was higher in the DCDD group (P = 0.007), and there was significantly more graft failure at 12 months (P = 0.03). In conclusion, we have demonstrated different perioperative and early postoperative courses for DCDD and donation after brain death (DBD) liver transplants. The overall quality of DCDD grafts is poorer; as a result, the length of the ITU stay and the need for multiorgan support are increased, and this has significant financial and resource implications. We believe that these implications require a careful real-life consideration of benefits. It is essential for DCDD not to be seen as a like-for-like alternative to DBD and for every effort to be continued to be made to increase the number of donations from brain-dead patients as a first resort.",

Primary Kupffer cells from control and from ethanol-fed rats incubated with arachidonic acid showed similar proliferation rates than nontreated cells; however, arachidonic acid induced phenotypic changes, lipid peroxidation, hydroperoxides, and superoxide radical generation. Similar effects occurred in human Kupffer cells. These events were greater in Kupffer cells from ethanol-fed rats, and antioxidants and inhibitors of arachidonic acid metabolism prevented them. Arachidonic acid treatment increased NADPH oxidase activity. Inhibitors of NADPH oxidase and of arachidonic acid metabolism partially prevented the increase in oxidant stress. Upon arachidonic acid stimulation, there was a rapid and sustained increase in TNFα, which was greater in Kupffer cells from ethanol-fed rats than in Kupffer cells from control rats. Arachidonic acid induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of early growth response-1 (Egr1), and ethanol synergized with arachidonic acid to promote this effect. PD98059, a mitogen extracellular kinase 1/2 inhibitor, and curcumin, an Egr1 inhibitor, blocked the arachidonic acid-mediated upregulation of TNFα in Kupffer cells. This study unveils the mechanism whereby arachidonic acid and ethanol increase TNFα production in Kupffer cells, thus contributing to alcoholic liver disease.",

Male Wistar rats were administered with MeHg orally at a dose of 5 mg/kg b.w. for 21 days. Experimental rats were given MeHg and also administered with BME (40 mg/kg, orally) 1 h prior to the administration of MeHg for 21 days. After treatment period, MeHg exposure significantly decreases the body weight and also caused the following behavioral changes. Decrease tail flick response, longer immobility time, significant decrease in motor activity, and spatial short-term memory. BME pretreatment reverted the behavioral changes to normal. MeHg exposure decreases the DNA and RNA content in cerebellum and also caused some pathological changes in cerebellum. Pretreatment with BME restored all the changes to near normal. These findings suggest that BME has a potent efficacy to alleviate MeHg-induced toxicity in rat cerebellum.",

Strain images are estimated using a 2-dimensional multilevel hybrid algorithm developed for sector array ultrasound transducers. Coarse displacements are initially estimated using envelope echo signals, followed by a guided finer displacement estimation using window lengths on the order of 6 wavelengths and 7 A-lines on radiofrequency data. Strain images are obtained by estimating displacement slopes using least squares estimation. In this prospective study, we show that stiffer masses such as fibroids appear darker or as regions with low strain on strain images and are thus clearly differentiated when compared to normal uterine tissue. A high strain boundary around stiffer masses referred to as a \"halo\" due to increased slipping or sliding of the mass during the applied deformation is also visualized. Uterine polyps, on the other hand, are visualized as masses that are brighter or regions with high strain when compared to the background myometrium, indicating the presence of a softer mass. Axial strain images provide additional new information that may supplement current clinical B-mode imaging used for the diagnosis of uterine abnormalities.

Recently more attention has been paid to behavioral disturbances caused by PD itself and by STN DBS. In the 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) PD rat model we investigated the effect of STN DBS on deficient prepulse inhibition (PPI) induced by the dopamine (DA) receptor agonist apomorphine, which is an operative measure for disturbed sensorimotor gating seen in certain neuropsychiatric disturbances. Male Sprague Dawley rats with bilateral lesions of the nigrostriatal DA system (striatal injection of 6-OHDA or vehicle for sham-lesion) were bilaterally implanted with electrodes for DBS into the STN. After determination of individual thresholds rats were stimulated (130Hz, 80μs pulse width) or sham-stimulated for epochs of six days. On the sixth day of each epoch rats were tested for PPI of the acoustic startle response after apomorphine or vehicle injection in a within randomized cross-over design. Stimulation of the STN improved PPI in vehicle-treated (control) rats, but deteriorated PPI after apomorphine treatment. This effect was more pronounced in sham-lesioned rats. Furthermore, in lesioned rats the startle reaction was marginally enhanced without effect of stimulation or apomorphine treatment. These data suggest that STN DBS interacts with dopaminergic action. With respect to functional neurosurgery, STN DBS alone may improve certain aspects of psychiatric disturbances, but may have a different impact when combined with dopaminergic medication.",

The use of conventional extracted soybean meal (SBM) in diets for Atlantic salmon and several other fish species is known to induce enteropathy in the distal intestine, a condition often referred to as SBM induced enteropathy (SBMIE). In the present study, we investigated the potential of different microbial ingredients to alleviate SBMIE in Atlantic salmon, as a model of feed-induced inflammation. The dietary treatments consisted of a negative control based on fish meal (FM), a positive control based on 20% SBM, and four experimental diets combining 20% SBM with either one of the three yeasts Candida utilis (CU), Kluyveromyces marxianus (KM), Saccharomyces cerevisiae (SC) or the microalgae Chlorella vulgaris (CV). Histopathological examination of the distal intestine showed that all fish fed the SC or SBM diets developed characteristic signs of SBMIE, while those fed the FM, CV or CU diets showed a healthy intestine. Fish fed the KM diet showed intermediate signs of SBMIE. Corroborating results were obtained when measuring the relative length of PCNA positive cells in the crypts of the distal intestine. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed decreased expression of amino acid, fat and drug metabolism pathways as well as increased expression of the pathways for NOD-like receptor signalling and chemokine signalling in both the SC and SBM groups while CV and CU were similar to FM and KM was intermediate. Gene expression of antimicrobial peptides was reduced in the groups showing SBMIE. The characterisation of microbial communities using PCR-DGGE showed a relative increased abundance of Firmicutes bacteria in fish fed the SC or SBM diets. Overall, our results show that both CU and CV were highly effective to counteract SBMIE, while KM had less effect and SC had no functional effects. ",

The intermediate filament protein keratin 8 (K8) and its cross-linking by transglutaminase-2 (TG2) are essential for MDB formation. K8 hyperphosphorylation occurs in association with liver injury and MDB formation, but the link between keratin phosphorylation and MDB formation is unknown. We used a mutational approach to identify K8 Q70 as a residue that is important for K8 cross-linking to itself and other liver proteins. K8 cross-linking is markedly enhanced on treating cells with a phosphatase inhibitor and decreases dramatically on K8 S74A or Q70N mutation in the presence of phosphatase inhibition. K8 Q70 cross-linking, in the context of synthetic peptides or intact proteins transfected into cells, is promoted by phosphorylation at K8 S74 or by an S74D substitution and is inhibited by S74A mutation. Transgenic mice that express K8 S74A or a K8 G62C liver disease variant that inhibits K8 S74 phosphorylation have a markedly reduced ability to form MDBs. Our findings support a model in which the stress-triggered phosphorylation of K8 S74 induces K8 cross-linking by TG2, leading to MDB formation. These findings may extend to neuropathies and myopathies that are characterized by intermediate filament-containing inclusions.",

Next-generation sequencing technologies have reached the maturity and low cost necessary to perform whole genome, whole exome, and targeted region sequencing to identify all rare risk alleles across a population, a task that is not possible to achieve by genotyping. Design of whole genome, whole exome, and targeted sequencing projects to identify disease variants for complex lung diseases requires four main steps: library preparation, sequencing, sequence data analysis, and statistical analysis. Although data analysis approaches are still evolving, a number of published studies have successfully identified rare variants associated with complex disease. Despite many challenges that lie ahead in applying these technologies to lung disease, rare variants are likely to be a critical piece of the puzzle that needs to be solved to understand the genetic basis of complex lung disease and to use this information to develop better therapies.",

A role of imbalance and dynamic switching of Th1/Th2 system has been proposed, with relative displacement of the immune reserve in relation to complex interaction between Th1/Th2 and neuro-hormonal balance fluctuations, in the pathogenesis of various chronic human diseases, probably also including psychiatric disorders. Components of the stress system such as norepinephrine (NE) and glucocorticoids appear to mediate a Th2 shift, while serotonin (5-HT) and melatonin might mediate a Th1 shift. Some antidepressants would occur affecting these systems, acting on neurotransmitter balance (especially the 5-HT/NE balance) and expression levels of receptor subtypes, which in turn affect cytokine production and relative Th1/Th2 balance. It could be therefore hypothesized that the antidepressant-related increase in NE tone enhances the Th2 response, while the decrease in NE tone or the increase in 5-HT tone enhances the Th1 response. However, the neurotransmitter and Th1/Th2 balance modulation could be relative, aiming to restore physiological levels a previous imbalance in receptor sensitivity and cytokine production. The considerations on neuro-immunomodulation could represent an additional aid in the study of pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders and in the choice of specific antidepressants in specific clusters of symptoms, especially in comorbidity with internal pathologies. Furthermore limited data, reviewed here, have shown the effectiveness of some antidepressants as pure immunomodulators. However, these considerations are tentative and require experimental confirmation or refutation by future studies.",

The synthesis of 5-HT is initiated by the hydroxylation of tryptophan, catalyzed by tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH). Two isoforms of TPH (TPH1 and TPH2) have been identified, with TPH2 almost exclusively expressed in the brain. Following TPH2 discovery, it was reported that polymorphisms of both gene and non-coding regions are associated with a spectrum of psychiatric disorders. Thus, insights into the mechanisms that specifically regulate TPH2 expression and its modulation by exogenous stimuli may represent a new therapeutic approach to modify serotonergic neurotransmission. To this aim, a CNS-originated cell line expressing TPH2 endogenously represents a valid model system. In this study, we report that TPH2 transcript and protein are modulated by neuronal differentiation in the cell line A1 mes-c-myc (A1). Moreover, we show luciferase activity driven by the human TPH2 promoter region and demonstrate that upon mutation of the NRSF/REST responsive element, the promoter activity strongly increases with cell differentiation. Our data suggest that A1 cells could represent a model system, allowing an insight into the mechanisms of regulation of TPH2 and to identify novel therapeutic targets in the development of drugs for the management of psychiatric disorders.",

Hemophilia A patients suffer from a bleeding diathesis, such as life-threatening bleeding in the brain and harmful bleeding in joints and muscles. Because it could potentially be cured by gene therapy, subhuman animal models have been sought. Current mouse hemophilia A models generated by gene targeting of the F8 have difficulties to extrapolate human disease due to differences in the coagulation and immune systems between mice and humans. Here, we generated a porcine model of hemophilia A by nuclear transfer cloning from F8-targeted fibroblasts. The hemophilia A pigs showed a severe bleeding tendency upon birth, similar to human severe hemophiliacs, but in contrast to hemophilia A mice which rarely bleed under standard breed conditions. Infusion of human factor VIII was effective in stopping bleeding and reducing the bleeding frequency of a hemophilia A piglet but was blocked by the inhibitor against human factor VIII. These data suggest that the hemophilia A pig is a severe hemophilia A animal model for studying not only hemophilia A gene therapy but also the next generation recombinant coagulation factors, such as recombinant factor VIII variants with a slower clearance rate.",

Not only do they attract the attention of psychiatrists, psychologists or sexologists, but also of public health professionals. It is because psychiatric disorders in sexual minorities are not only the source of individual suffering and dysfunction, but also a big and so far unappreciated social problem. The research results in this field were mostly unreliable in the past, because they were based on the false paradigm, assuming that homosexuality unquestionably belongs in the realms of psychopathology. This became a major selection bias in which researchers tried to draw conclusion upon the mental status of the hole population of homosexual people only from studies of clinical populations. New studies analyse the mental status of this relatively big social group implementing data from epidemiological population-based studies, which allows the more realistic assessment of the problem. In this work we presented new data indicating the elevated risk of psychiatric disorders within the sexual minorities. The problem was discussed in the context of living in the reluctant and hostile environment (minority stress exposure).",

Self-rated information on physical health, mental well-being, long-term sickness absence, and changes in social roles was used. Information on psychiatric disorders was based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-III-R and Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV diagnoses. Multivariate logistic regressions were adjusted for age, socio-economic position, alcohol dependence and abuse, and health at baseline. An increase in number of social roles was associated with lower odds for poor mental well-being, odds ratio (OR) 0.4 (confidence interval [CI] 0.2 to 0.8), while a decrease was associated with higher odds for poor mental well-being, OR 4.5 (CI 1.8 to 11.0), psychiatric disorder, OR 2.6 (1.0 to 6.8), and sickness absence, OR 4.4 (1.6 to 11.7). The results indicated that an increase in number of social roles might be protective against poor mental well-being, while a decrease in number of roles might be related to increased psychiatric disorders and long-term sickness absence.

Here, we aimed at investigating the presence of neuroanatomical abnormalities in relapsing-remitting MS patients with (RR-MSc) and without (RR-MSnc) cerebellar signs. Twelve RR-MSc patients, 14 demographically, clinically, and radiologically, matched RR-MSnc patients and 20 controls were investigated. All patients underwent neuropsychological assessment. After refilling of FLAIR lesions on the 3D T1-weighted images, VBM was performed using SPM8 and DARTEL. A correlation analysis was performed between VBM results and neuropsychological variables characterizing RR-MSc patients. Despite a similar clinical status, RR-MSc patients were characterized by more severe cognitive damages in attention and language domains with respect to RR-MSnc and controls. With respect to controls, RR-MSnc patients were characterized by a specific atrophy of the bilateral thalami that became more widespread (including motor cortex) in the RR-MSc group (FWE < 0.05). However, consistent with their well-defined neuropsychological deficits, RR-MSc group showed atrophies in the prefrontal and temporal cortical areas when directly compared with RR-MSnc group.

The link with disease allowed measures to be developed that now provide an opportunity to intervene and slow down or even restore sight in previously 'untreatable' retinal diseases. One of the critical advances has been the understanding of the retinal amino acid neurotransmitters, related amino acids, their metabolites and functional receptors. This review provides an overview of amino acid localisation in the retina and examples of how retinal anatomy and amino acid neurochemistry directly links to understanding retinal disease. Also, the implications of retinal remodelling involving amino acid (glutamate) receptors are outlined in this review and insights are presented on how understanding of detrimental and beneficial retinal remodelling will provide better outcomes for patients using strategies for the preservation or restoration of vision.

The aim of our study was to achieve an efficient in vivo transfection of MUC5AC, restore its normal levels in an inflamed ocular surface and determine whether restored MUC5AC levels improve ocular surface inflammation. Cationized gelatin-based nanoparticles (NPs) loaded with a plasmid coding a modified MUC5AC protein (pMUC5AC) were instilled in healthy and experimental dry eye (EDE) mice. MUC5AC expression, clinical signs, corneal fluorescein staining and tear production were evaluated. Ocular specimens were processed for histopathologic evaluation, including goblet cell count and CD4 immunostaining. Neither ocular discomfort nor irritation was observed in vivo after NP treatment. Expression of modified MUC5AC was significantly higher in ocular surface tissue of pMUC5AC-NP-treated animals than that of controls. In healthy mice, pMUC5AC-NPs had no effect on fluorescein staining or tear production. In EDE mice, both parameters significantly improved after pMUC5AC-NP treatment. Anterior eye segment of treated mice showed normal architecture and morphology with lack of remarkable inflammatory changes, and a decrease in CD4+ T-cell infiltration. Thus, pMUC5AC-NPs were well tolerated and able to induce the expression of modified MUC5A in ocular surface tissue, leading to reduction of the inflammation and, consequently improving the associated clinical parameters, such as tear production and fluorescein staining. These results identify a potential application of pMUC5AC-NPs as a new therapeutic modality for the treatment of dry eye disease.",

From this total sample 686 were not receiving special education services (categorized as \"no disability\"), and 130 were receiving special education services (categorized as \"observable disability,\" \"non-observable disability,\" and \"behavioral disability\"). Data on students' involvement in bullying, office referrals, and prosocial behavior were collected. Results indicated that students with behavioral disorders and those with observable disabilities reported bullying others more and being victimized more than their general education counterparts. Students with behavioral disorders also had significantly more office referrals than students in general education. Seventh graders in general education reported more bullying behavior than sixth graders and ninth grades in general education. Fifth graders in general education reported more victimization than students in all other grades in general education. However, the grade differences were not significant for students in special education. No gender differences on bullying and victimization were found.

In both acute and chronic liver injury, hepatic chemokine expression is induced resulting in inflammatory cell infiltration, angiogenesis, and cell activation and survival. During acute injury, massive parenchymal cell death due to apoptosis and/or necrosis leads to chemokine production by hepatocytes, cholangiocytes, Kupffer cells, hepatic stellate cells, and sinusoidal endothelial cells. The specific chemokine profile expressed during injury is dependent on both the type and course of injury. Hepatotoxicity by acetaminophen for example leads to cellular necrosis and activation of Toll-like receptors while the inciting insult in ischemia reperfusion injury produces reactive oxygen species and subsequent production of pro-inflammatory chemokines. Chemokine expression by these cells generates a chemoattractant gradient promoting infiltration by monocytes/macrophages, NK cells, NKT cells, neutrophils, B cells, and T cells whose activity are highly regulated by the specific chemokine profiles within the liver. Additionally, resident hepatic cells express chemokine receptors both in the normal and injured liver. While the role of these receptors in normal liver has not been well described, during injury, receptor up-regulation, and chemokine engagement leads to cellular survival, proliferation, apoptosis, fibrogenesis, and expression of additional chemokines and growth factors. Hepatic-derived chemokines can therefore function in both paracrine and autocrine fashions further expanding their role in liver disease. More recently it has been appreciated that chemokines can have diverging effects depending on their temporal expression pattern and the type of injury. A better understanding of chemokine/chemokine receptor axes will therefore pave the way for development of novel targeted therapies for the treatment of liver disease.",

In this introductory article to the current special issue, we propose that neuroeconomics is a potential bridge for translational research in psychiatry for several reasons. First, neuroeconomics-derived theoretical predictions about optimal adaptation in a changing environment provide an objective metric to examine psychopathology. Second, neuroeconomics provides a \"multilevel\" research approach that combines performance (behavioral) measures with intermediate measures between behavior and neurobiology (e.g., neuroimaging) and uses a common metaphor to describe decision-making across multiple levels of explanation. As such, ecologically valid behavioral paradigms closely mirror the physical mechanisms of reward processing. Third, neuroeconomics provides a platform for investigators from neuroscience, economics, psychiatry, and social and clinical psychology to develop a common language for studying reward-related decision making in psychiatric disorders. Therefore, neuroeconomics can provide promising candidate endophenotypes that might help clarify the basis of high heritability associated with psychiatric disorders and that might, in turn, inform treatment.",

        "medline_abstract_text":"Psychiatric disorders are phenotypically heterogeneous entities with a complex genetic basis. To mitigate this complexity, many investigators study so-called intermediate phenotypes (IPs) that putatively provide a more direct index of the physiological effects of candidate genetic risk variants than overt psychiatric syndromes. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a particularly popular technique for measuring such phenotypes because it allows interrogation of diverse aspects of brain structure and function in vivo. Much of this work however, has focused on relatively simple measures that quantify variations in the physiology or tissue integrity of specific brain regions in isolation, contradicting an emerging consensus that most major psychiatric disorders do not arise from isolated dysfunction in one or a few brain regions, but rather from disturbed interactions within and between distributed neural circuits; i.e., they are disorders of brain connectivity. The recent proliferation of new MRI techniques for comprehensively mapping the entire connectivity architecture of the brain, termed the human connectome, has provided a rich repertoire of tools for understanding how genetic variants implicated in mental disorder impact distinct neural circuits. In this article, we review research using these connectomic techniques to understand how genetic variation influences the connectivity and topology of human brain networks. We highlight recent evidence from twin and imaging genetics studies suggesting that the penetrance of candidate risk variants for mental illness, such as those in SLC6A4, MAOA, ZNF804A, and APOE, may be higher for IPs characterized at the level of distributed neural systems than at the level of spatially localized brain regions. The findings indicate that imaging connectomics provides a powerful framework for understanding how genetic risk for psychiatric disease is expressed through altered structure and function of the human connectome.",

FXIII-B protects FXIII-A from its clearance. FXIII-A is also present as a homodimer inside megakaryocytes/platelets and monocytes/macrophages. Although possible functions of intracellular FXIII-A have been proposed, these remain to be established. Intra- and extra-cellular FXIIIs support platelet adhesion and spreading as well as clot retraction, suggesting that FXIII is important for the stabilization of platelet-fibrin clots. Intra- and extra-cellular FXIIIs also support immobilization and killing of bacteria as well as phagocytosis by macrophages. Thus, FXIII may function in innate immunity. Congenital FXIII deficiency due to defective F13-A genes manifests as a life-long bleeding tendency, abnormal wound healing, and recurrent miscarriage. Although congenital FXIII-B deficiency used to be thought rare, reports of such cases have increased recently. As the bleeding tendency is often mild, patients with FXIII-B deficiency may be overlooked by physicians. Patients with acquired FXIII deficiency, in particular those with autoimmune hemorrhaphilia due to anti-FXIII antibodies, are on the increase, at least in Japan. It is important to diagnose such cases as early as possible, and to treat them with immunosuppression in combination with FXIII replacement therapy as their bleeding symptoms can be life-threatening.",

Integrative genomics augment these strategies by enabling rapid informatics-assisted candidate gene prioritization, cross-species translation, and mechanistic comparison across related disorders from a wealth of existing data in mouse and other model organisms. Ultimately, through these complementary approaches, finding the mechanisms and sources of genetic variation underlying complex neurobehavioral disease related traits is becoming tractable.

Several known genetic risk factors for psychiatric disease are related to the regulation of actin polymerization, which plays a key role in synaptic plasticity. To gain insight into and test the possible pathogenetic role of this pathway, we designed a conditional knock-out of the Arp2/3 complex, a conserved final output for actin signaling pathways that orchestrates de novo actin polymerization. Here we report that postnatal loss of the Arp2/3 subunit ArpC3 in forebrain excitatory neurons leads to an asymmetric structural plasticity of dendritic spines, followed by a progressive loss of spine synapses. This progression of synaptic deficits corresponds with an evolution of distinct cognitive, psychomotor, and social disturbances as the mice age. Together, these results point to the dysfunction of actin signaling, specifically that which converges to regulate Arp2/3, as an important cellular pathway that may contribute to the etiology of complex psychiatric disorders.",

In contrast, protein-incorporated Arg residues can be methylated with subsequent proteolysis giving rise to methylarginine compounds, such as asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) that competes with Arg for binding to NOS. Most ADMA is degraded by dimethylarginine dimethyaminohydrolase (DDAH), distributed widely throughout the body and regulates ADMA levels and, therefore, NO synthesis. In recent years, several studies have suggested that increased ADMA levels are a marker of atherosclerotic change, and can be used to assess cardiovascular risk, consistent with ADMA being predominantly absorbed by endothelial cells. NO is an important messenger molecule involved in numerous biological processes, and its activity is essential to understand both pathogenic and therapeutic mechanisms in kidney disease and renal transplantation. NO production is reduced in renal patients because of their elevated ADMA levels with associated reduced DDAH activity. These factors contribute to endothelial dysfunction, oxidative stress and the progression of renal damage, but there are treatments that may effectively reduce ADMA levels in patients with kidney disease. Available data on ADMA levels in controls and renal patients, both in adults and children, also are summarized in this review.",

Restoration of BDNF-dependent activity could alleviate these impairments, but BDNF has limited clinical utility due to its pharmacokinetics. Here we demonstrate that activation of a primary BDNF target, the tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB) receptor, enhances the amplitude and prolongs the decay kinetics of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) currents in male rat infralimbic prefrontal pyramidal neurons. Moreover, these effects were prevented and reversed by blockade of NMDARs containing the GluN2B subunit. Our results show that this signaling cascade bidirectionally regulates extinction of a cocaine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP), a task that requires behavioral flexibility. Blockade of infralimbic TrkB receptors or GluN2B-containing NMDARs disrupted consolidation of extinction of the CPP. In contrast, extinction was strengthened by potentiation of TrkB receptor activity with infralimbic infusions of BDNF or systemic injections of 7,8 dihydroxyflavone (7,8DHF), the newly synthesized TrkB receptor agonist. The 7,8DHF-induced enhancement of extinction was prevented by infralimbic infusions of a GluN2B-specific receptor antagonist, demonstrating that TrkB receptor activation enhances extinction of cocaine-CPP via GluN2B-containing NMDARs. Together, infralimbic TrkB receptor activation strengthens GluN2B-containing NMDAR currents to support extinction learning. TrkB receptor agonists would therefore be useful as pharmacological adjuncts for extinction-based therapies for treatment of psychiatric disorders associated with reduced BDNF activity. ",

We evaluated the quality and consistency of hepatic dosing recommendations, and compared contemporary clinical practice of dosing in patients with impaired hepatic function with product labels. All new molecular entities (NME) and labels approved by the FDA during the period of January 2004 to December 2011 were reviewed. The fraction of the dose hepatically eliminated, quality of hepatic impairment PK studies reported, and any dose recommendations provided in the label and in a tertiary clinical reference (Micromedex) were reviewed. Out of 157 NMEs, 67 met the criteria for evaluation of dosing in hepatic disease. Problem areas were identified related to the lack of specific hepatic metabolism information in 90% of FDA-approved labels, inconsistent terminology, and \"use with caution in liver disease\" in 27% of NME. Updating the FDA guidance on PK studies in patients with impaired hepatic function could provide a standardized approach to improve the clinical usefulness of this dosing information for practitioners.

Although known to be associated with suppression of some cellular aspects of innate immunity and a prominent lymphocytic hyperplasia, there remains a considerable knowledge gap in our understanding of the underlying immune mechanisms driving PKD pathogenesis. To provide further insights, the expression profiles of a panel of innate/inflammatory and adaptive immune molecules were examined in rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss following a natural exposure to the parasite. Relative to controls, fish with early to advanced stages of kidney pathology exhibited up-regulation of the inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-11, although remaining refractory towards genes indicative of macrophage activity. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and anti-inflammatory markers, including cathelicidin (CATH) and IL-10 were markedly up-regulated during clinical disease. Up-regulation of adaptive immune molecules, including cell markers and antibody genes reflect the lymphocytic dominance of this disease and the likely importance of lymphocyte subsets in PKD pathogenesis. Up-regulation of T helper (TH) cell-like response genes and transcription factors implies that T. bryosalmonae may elicit a complex interplay between TH cell subsets. This work, for the first time in the study of fish-myxozoan interactions, suggests that PKD pathogenesis is shaped by an anti-inflammatory phenotype, a profound B cell/antibody response and dysregulated TH cell-like activities. A better understanding of the functional roles of fish immune cells and molecules in PKD pathogenesis may facilitate future development of control measures against this disease.",

Dysregulation of an important lipid uptake and trafficking gene, liver-fatty acid binding protein (L-FABP), may contribute to alterations in lipid homeostasis during early-stage alcoholic liver. We have reported the detrimental effects of ethanol on the expression of L-FABP and hypothesize this may deleteriously impact metabolic networks regulating fatty acids. Male wild-type (WT) and L-FABP(-/-) mice were fed a modified Lieber-DeCarli liquid diet for six weeks. To assess the response to chronic ethanol ingestion, standard biochemical indicators for alcoholic liver disease (ALD) and oxidative stress were measured. Ethanol ingestion resulted in attenuation of hepatic triglyceride accumulation and elevation of cholesterol in L-FABP(-/-) mice. Lipidomics analysis validated multiple alterations in hepatic lipids resulting from ethanol treatment. Increased immunohistochemical staining for the reactive aldehydes 4-hydroxynonenal and malondialdehyde were observed in WT mice ingesting ethanol; however, L-FABP(-/-) mice displayed prominent protein adducts in liver sections evaluated from pair-fed and ethanol-fed mice. Likewise, alterations in glutathione, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), 8-isoprostanes, and protein carbonyl content all indicated L-FABP(-/-) mice exhibit high sustained oxidative stress in the liver. These data establish that L-FABP is an indirect antioxidant protein essential for sequestering FFA and that its impairment could contribute to in the pathogenesis of ALD.",

This has resulted in insurability problems for some donors. This article reviews the definition of CKD, risks associated with CKD, and large follow-up studies on the vital status and risk of ESRD in kidney donors. It also provides evidence that kidney donors, despite having reduced GFR, are not at increased risk for CKD-associated morbidity and mortality. Epidemiologic studies, most with follow-up <10 years, have shown an association between GFR <60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) and higher mortality and progression to ESRD. Low GFR in the absence of any other markers for kidney disease, however, conveys attenuated or minimal risk. Of note, studies of long-term kidney donor outcomes (6-45 years) have not shown excess mortality or ESRD. The limitation of the collective evidence is that the increased risks associated with GFR <60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) were demonstrated in much larger cohorts than those reported for kidney donor outcomes, but donor outcome studies have substantially longer follow-up. On the basis of current findings, kidney donors with low GFR and no other signs of kidney disease should not be classified as having CKD. This is definitely not the reward they deserve, and, more important, the implications of reduced GFR in donors are not associated with unfavorable outcomes. ",

        "medline_abstract_text":"Humans vary in their ability to delay gratification and impulsive decision making is a common feature in various psychiatric disorders. The level of delay discounting is a relatively stable psychological trait, and therefore neural processes implicated in delay discounting are likely to be based on the overall functional organization of the brain (under task-free conditions) in which state-dependent shifts from baseline levels occur. The current study investigated whether delay discounting can be predicted by intrinsic properties of brain functioning. Fourteen healthy male subjects performed a delay discounting task. In addition, resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (¹H MRS) were used to investigate the relationship between individual differences in delay discounting and molecular and regional measures of resting state (baseline) activity of dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC). Results showed that delay discounting was associated with both dACC glutamate concentrations and resting state functional connectivity of the dACC with a midbrain region including ventral tegmental area and substantia nigra. In addition, a neural pathway was established, showing that the effect of glutamate concentrations in the dACC on delay discounting is mediated by functional connectivity of the dACC with the midbrain. The current findings are important to acknowledge because spontaneous intrinsic brain processes have been proposed to be a potential promising biomarker of disease and impulsive decision making is associated with several psychiatric disorders.",

This retrospective study evaluated the impact of the pretransplant model for end stage liver disease (MELD) on the incidence of posttransplant IFI in a single centre. From 2004 to 2008, 385 liver transplantations were included, from which 210 transplantations were conducted allocated by Child Turcotte Pugh and 175 were allocated by MELD score. Both groups differed regarding the age of transplant recipients (50.1 ± 10.7 vs. 52.5 ± 9.9, P = 0.036), pretransplant MELD score (16.43 ± 8.33 vs. 18.29 ± 9.05), rate of re-transplantations, duration of surgery, demand in blood transfusions and rates of renal impairments. In the MELD era, higher incidences of IFI (pre-MELD 11.9%, MELD 24.0%, P < 0.05) and Candida infections (9% vs. 18.9%, P < 0.05) were observed. There was no difference in the incidence of probable or possible aspergillosis. Mortality, length of stay in intensive care or hospital, and duration of mechanical ventilation did not differ between the pre-MELD and MELD era. Regardless the date of transplantation, patients with fungi-positive samples showed higher mortality rates than patients without. MELD score was analysed as independent predictors for posttransplant IFI. Higher MELD scores predispose to a more problematic postoperative course and are associated with an increase in fungal infections.",

Few pharmacokinetic (PK) studies have focused on drug treatment for nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) disease, although a favourable treatment response occurs in just over 50% of patients despite drug treatment for ≥1 year. A prospective, descriptive PK study was performed to assess the plasma pharmacokinetics of rifampicin, ethambutol, clarithromycin, 14-OH-clarithromycin, azithromycin, isoniazid and moxifloxacin. Intensive PK sampling was performed in 14 patients with clinically relevant NTM lung disease. PK parameters were assessed and were compared with available data from the literature. Exposure to clarithromycin when combined with rifampicin was very low [area under the concentration-time curve over 12 h (AUC(0-12 h), geometric mean 2.6 h·mg/L, range 1.6-3.2 h·mg/L; peak concentration in plasma (C(max)), geometric mean 0.3 mg/L, range 0.1-0.7 mg/L]. The mean parent-to-metabolite ratios for clarithromycin to 14-OH-clarithromycin were 0.4 and 0.3 for AUC(0-12 h) and C(max), instead of the typical ratio of ca. 3, probably reflecting increased metabolism of clarithromycin to its (virtually inactive) 14-OH metabolite. Exposure to rifampicin was relatively high, with all patients having a rifampicin C(max) within the reference range. The majority of ethambutol C(max) values were within the reference range. The current study re-emphasises the relevant PK interaction between clarithromycin and rifampicin. This calls for a re-evaluation of dosing strategies in NTM lung disease, as suboptimal drug exposure may contribute to inadequate response to treatment of NTM disease.",

From such a perspective, diagnostic procedures and forthcoming systems of classification of mental disorders should attempt to combine descriptive, categorical and dimensional approaches, addressing more attention to the cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis of nuclear, subclinical, and atypical symptoms that may represent a pattern of either full-blown or partially expressed psychiatric comorbidity.

We characterized the bacterial communities in 126 sputum samples representing serial collections spanning 8-9 y from six age-matched male CF patients. Sputum DNA was analyzed by bar-coded pyrosequencing of the V3-V5 hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA gene, defining 662 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) from >633,000 sequences. Bacterial community diversity decreased significantly over time in patients with typically progressive lung disease but remained relatively stable in patients with a mild lung disease phenotype. Antibiotic use, rather than patient age or lung function, was the primary driver of decreasing diversity. Interpatient variability in community structure exceeded intrapatient variability in serial samples. Antibiotic treatment was associated with pronounced shifts in community structure, but communities showed both short- and long-term resilience after antibiotic perturbation. There was a positive correlation between OTU occurrence and relative abundance, with a small number of persistent OTUs accounting for the greatest abundance. Significant changes in community structure, diversity, or total bacterial density at the time of pulmonary exacerbation were not observed. Despite decreasing community diversity in patients with progressive disease, total bacterial density remained relatively stable over time. These findings show the critical relationship between airway bacterial community structure, disease stage, and clinical state at the time of sample collection. These features are the key parameters with which to assess the complex ecology of the CF airway.",

To better understand the molecular mechanisms of the liver and its diseases, mouse liver microsomes were isolated and enriched with differential centrifugation and sucrose gradient centrifugation, and microsome membrane proteins were further extracted from isolated microsomal fractions by the carbonate method. The enriched microsome proteins were arrayed with two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DE) and carbonate-extracted microsome membrane proteins with one-dimensional gel electrophoresis (1DE). A total of 183 2DE-arrayed proteins and 99 1DE-separated proteins were identified with tandem mass spectrometry. A total of 259 nonredundant microsomal proteins were obtained and represent the proteomic profile of mouse liver microsomes, including 62 definite microsome membrane proteins. The comprehensive bioinformatics analyses revealed the functional categories of those microsome proteins and provided clues into biological functions of the liver. The systematic analyses of the proteomic profile of mouse liver microsomes not only reveal essential, valuable information about the biological function of the liver, but they also provide important reference data to analyze liver disease-related microsome proteins for biomarker discovery and mechanism clarification of liver disease.",

However, the earliest impact of the loss of CFTR function on airway physiology and structure and its relationship to initial infection and inflammation are poorly understood. Universal newborn screening for CF in the United States represents an unprecedented opportunity for investigating CF clinical manifestations very early in life. Recently developed animal models with pulmonary phenotypic manifestations also provide a window into the early consequences of this genetic disorder. For these reasons, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) convened a working group of extramural experts, entitled \"Future Research Directions in Early CF Lung Disease\" on September 21-22, 2010, to identify future research directions of great promise in CF. The priority areas identified included (1) exploring pathogenic mechanisms of early CF lung disease; (2) leveraging newborn screening to elucidate the natural history of early lung disease; (3) developing a spectrum of biomarkers of early lung disease that reflects CF pathophysiology, clinical outcome, and response to treatment; (4) exploring the role of genetics/genomics (e.g., modifier genes, gene-environmental interactions, and epigenetics) in early CF pathogenesis; (5) defining early microbiological events in CF lung disease; and (6) elucidating the initial airway inflammatory, remodeling, and repair mechanisms in CF lung disease.",

Previous studies have frequently reported high prevalence of prior child and adolescent sexual abuse among adult victims of sexual violence. This raises uncertainty over the specific contribution of sexual victimization in adulthood to the adverse psychological outcomes. The present study draws on a large nationally representative sample of adults without history of childhood sexual abuse, and applies diagnostic criteria of DSM-IV, in order to investigate the risk factors and psychiatric comorbidities correlated with sexual victimization in adulthood. In a large representative sample of U.S. adults without history of childhood sexual abuse, 2.5% reported sexual victimization in adulthood. Female gender, living alone, economic disadvantage, and a history of childhood adversities and parental psychopathology were identified as risk factors. Adult sexual victimization increased the risk of developing a variety of psychiatric disorders, especially PTSD (HR = 3.43, 95% CI [2.67, 4.41]) and drug abuse (HR = 3.38, 95% CI [2.49, 4.58]). Conversely, pre-existing psychiatric psychopathology, particularly PTSD (HR = 3.99, 95% CI [2.68, 5.94]) and dysthymia (HR = 2.26, 95% CI [1.42, 3.59]), increased the likelihood of sexual victimization in adulthood. Childhood experience and adulthood sociodemographic characteristics are important in affecting the risk of being sexually victimized in adulthood.

On four separate occasions over 3 years, symptoms and impact were assessed in a UK epidemiological sample (n = 4,479; 51.5 % boys) using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) as reported by parents, youths and teachers. Disorders were ascertained using the Development and Well-Being Assessment. An impact scale made of items about distress and impairment demonstrated considerable internal consistency, cross-informant correlations, and longitudinal stability by all reporting sources. Impact at baseline was a strong predictor of psychiatric disorder 3 years later after accounting for psychiatric disorders and symptoms measured at baseline: odds ratio OR = 2.10, 95 % Confidence Interval (CI) [1.50, 2.94] according to parent-rated impact and OR = 1.71, CI [1.08, 2.72] according to teacher-rated impact. Changes in impact over time were predicted, but not fully accounted for, by symptoms measured at baseline. Impact can be reliably and easily measured across time, and it may be clinically useful as an independent predictor of future symptoms and psychiatric disorders.

The pathogenesis of BPD is multifactorial, but all triggers cause pulmonary inflammation. No therapy exists; therefore, we investigated whether the anti-inflammatory interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) prevents murine BPD. We precipitated BPD by perinatal inflammation (lipopolysaccharide injection to pregnant dams) and rearing pups in hyperoxia (65% or 85% O2). Pups were treated daily with IL-1Ra or vehicle for up to 28 d. Vehicle-injected animals in both levels of hyperoxia developed a severe BPD-like lung disease (alveolar number and gas exchange area decreased by up to 60%, alveolar size increased up to fourfold). IL-1Ra prevented this structural disintegration at 65%, but not 85% O2. Hyperoxia depleted pulmonary immune cells by 67%; however, extant macrophages and dendritic cells were hyperactivated, with CD11b and GR1 (Ly6G/C) highly expressed. IL-1Ra partially rescued the immune cell population in hyperoxia (doubling the viable cells), reduced the percentage that were activated by up to 63%, and abolished the unexpected persistence of IL-1α and IL-1β on day 28 in hyperoxia/vehicle-treated lungs. On day 3, perinatal inflammation and hyperoxia each triggered a distinct pulmonary immune response, with some proinflammatory mediators increasing up to 20-fold and some amenable to partial or complete reversal with IL-1Ra. In summary, our analysis reveals a pivotal role for IL-1α/β in murine BPD and an involvement for MIP (macrophage inflammatory protein)-1α and TREM (triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells)-1. Because it effectively shields newborn mice from BPD, IL-1Ra emerges as a promising treatment for a currently irremediable disease that may potentially brighten the prognosis of the tiny preterm patients.

Liver transplantation (LT) is an accepted therapy, but the effects of liver disease and LT on pulmonary function in patients with CF are controversial. Our aim was to characterize changes in pulmonary function in LT patients with CF. Using mixed effect models, we analyzed pulmonary function before and after transplantation in 168 LT patients and 840 non-LT patients with CF who were matched by age, sex, pancreatic status, infections with US CF Foundation Patient Registry data (1989-2007). The primary outcome was the change in the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV(1); percent predicted) in LT and non-LT in the 3-years periods before or after transplantation; second we compared FEV(1) changes. In the 3 years before transplantation, LT had lower initial FEV(1) values (71.5% ± 1.9%, P < 0.001) and a slower decline (+0.1% ± 0.4%/year, P < 0.001) than non-LT (79.6% ± 1.3% and -1.3% ± 0.2%/year, respectively). There was no difference in the FEV(1) decline after transplantation (-1.4% ± 0.4%/year for LT versus -2.1% ± 0.2%/year for non-LT, P = 0.14). Both the (P = 0.003) and (P = 0.001) had a slower FEV(1) decline in the period before transplantation versus after transplantation. In conclusion, pulmonary function is lower and declines more slowly in patients with CF before LT versus, but parallels the decline in non-LT after transplantation. LT is neither beneficial nor detrimental to pulmonary function in CF but returns FEV(1) decline to the same trajectory found for matched non-LT individuals with CF.",

However, standard imaging techniques such as CT and MRI imaging during breath-holds provide little or no information on lung motion and cannot detect diseases that cause subtle changes in lung structure. Phase-contrast X-ray imaging provides images of high contrast and spatial resolution with temporal resolutions that allow multiple images to be acquired throughout the respiratory cycle. Using X-ray phase-contrast imaging, coupled with velocimetry, we have measured lung tissue movement and determined velocity fields that define speed and direction of regional lung motion throughout a breath in normal Balb/c nude male mice and mice exposed to bleomycin. Regional maps of lung tissue motion reveal both the heterogeneity of normal lung motion, as well as abnormal motion induced by bleomycin treatment. Analysed histologically, bleomycin treatment caused pathological changes in lung structure that were heterogenous, occupying less than 12% of the lung at 6 days after treatment. Moreover, plethysmography failed to detect significant changes in compliance at either 36 h or 6 days after treatment. Detailed analysis of the vector fields demonstrated major differences (p < 0.001) in regional lung motion between control and bleomycin-treated mice at both 36 h and 6 days after treatment. The results of this study demonstrate that X-ray phase-contrast imaging, coupled with velocimetry, can detect early stage, subtle and non-uniform lung disease.",

Although much of this research has shown a direct link between high emotional reactivity and maladjustment, there is less research on the ways in which reactivity interacts with contextual factors. Using data from the National Institute of Child Health & Human Development Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development (SECCYD), the current study asks how emotional reactivity in childhood, household chaos, and household income impact changes in emotional and behavioral problems between childhood and adolescence. Participants in the SECCYD were followed from birth until adolescence. Of these, 958 youth (52 % male; 80 % Caucasian, 13 % African American, 2 % Asian, and 5 % Other) who completed measures at age 15 were included in the current study. Results indicate that emotional reactivity and low household income during childhood directly predict higher levels of emotional and behavioral problems in adolescence. In contrast, the impact of household chaos on adolescent mental health depends on the child's emotional reactivity. Specifically, the adverse impact of household chaos on emotional problems was observed among adolescents who were highly emotionally reactive as children, but not among their less reactive counterparts. Taken together, the relationship between an individual's childhood context and temperament are important aspects in the prediction of outcomes in adolescents.",

        "medline_abstract_text":"In recipients of liver transplantation (LT), surgical site infection (SSIs) are among the most common types of infection occurring in the first 60 days after LT. In 2007, the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) scoring system was adopted as the basis for prioritizing organ allocation. Patients with higher MELD scores are at higher risk for developing SSIs as well as other health care-associated infections. However, there have been no studies comparing the incidence of SSIs in the pre-MELD era with the incidence in the period since its adoption. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to evaluate the incidence, etiology, epidemiology, and outcomes of post-LT SSIs in those 2 periods and to identify risk factors for SSIs. We evaluated all patients who underwent LT over a 10-year period (2002-2011). SSI cases were identified through active surveillance. The primary outcome measure was an SSI during the first 60 days after LT. Risk factors were analyzed via logistic regression, and 60-day survival rates were evaluated via Cox regression. We evaluated 543 patients who underwent LT 597 times. The SSI rates in the 2002-2006 and 2007-2011 periods were 30% and 24%, respectively (P = 0.21). We identified the following risk factors for SSIs: retransplantation, the transfusion of more than 2 U of blood during LT, dialysis, cold ischemia for >400 minutes, and a cytomegalovirus infection. The overall 60-day survival rate was 79%. Risk factors for 60-day mortality were retransplantation, dialysis, and a longer surgical time. The use of the MELD score modified the incidence and epidemiology of SSIs only during the first year after its adoption. Risks for SSIs were related more to intraoperative conditions and intercurrences after LT than to a patient's status before LT.",

Even though ongoing research is dedicated to the goal of bringing MSCs to clinical applications, further understanding of the complex underlying mechanisms is required. Autophagy, a type II programmed cell death, controls cellular recycling through the lysosomal system in damaged cells or tissues. However, it is still unknown whether MSCs can trigger autophagy to enhance regeneration and/or to provide a therapeutic effect as cellular survival promoters. We therefore investigated autophagy's activation in carbon tetrachloride (CCl4 )-injured rat liver following transplantation with chorionic plate-derived MSCs (CP-MSCs) isolated from placenta. The expression markers for apoptosis, autophagy, cell survival, and liver regeneration were analyzed. Whereas caspase 3/7 activities were reduced (p < .05), the expression levels of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) and factors for autophagy, survival, and regeneration were significantly increased by CP-MSCs transplantation. Decreased necrotic cells (p < .05) and increased autophagic signals (p < .005) were observed in CCl4 -treated primary rat hepatocytes during in vitro coculture with CP-MSCs. Furthermore, the upregulation of HIF-1α promotes the regeneration of damaged hepatic cells through an autophagic mechanism marked by increased levels of light chain 3 II (LC 3II). These results suggest that the administration of CP-MSCs promotes repair by systemically concomitant mechanisms involving HIF-1α and autophagy. These findings provide further understanding of the mechanisms involved in these processes and will help develop new cell-based therapeutic strategies for regenerative medicine in liver disease.",

Greater than 70% of the body's retinoid reserves are stored in the liver as retinyl ester (RE). Chronic alcohol consumption induces depletion of hepatic retinoid stores, and the extent of this has been correlated with advancing stages of alcoholic liver disease. The goal of this study was to analyze the mechanisms responsible for depletion of hepatic RE stores by alcohol consumption A change in the fatty-acyl composition of RE in alcohol-fed mice was observed within two weeks after the start of alcohol consumption. Specifically, alcohol-feeding was associated with a significant decline in hepatic retinyl palmitate levels; however, total RE levels were maintained by a compensatory increase in levels of usually minor RE species, particularly retinyl oleate. Our data suggests that alcohol feeding initially stimulates a futile cycle of RE hydrolysis and synthesis, and that the change in RE acyl composition is associated with a change in the acyl composition of hepatic phosphatidylcholine. The alcohol-induced change in RE acyl composition was specific to the liver, and was not seen in lung or white adipose tissue. This shift in hepatic RE fatty acyl composition is a sensitive indicator of alcohol consumption and may be an early biomarker for events associated with the development of alcoholic liver disease.",

Here we formulate and analyze a metapopulation model that incorporates several scenarios of self-initiated behavioral changes into the mobility patterns of individuals. We find that prevalence-based travel limitations do not alter the epidemic invasion threshold. Strikingly, we observe in both synthetic and data-driven numerical simulations that when travelers decide to avoid locations with high levels of prevalence, this self-initiated behavioral change may enhance disease spreading.

These ENaC inhibitors may be used in blocking transepithelial sodium and consequently water absorption across airway epithelia. This may result in airway rehydration and enhanced mucociliary clearance in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease. All inhibitors resemble the classical ENaC blocker amiloride but follow different strategies to increase structural diversity in a sterically tolerant region. These substitutions can be modified to i) enhance potency of ENaC inhibition; ii) reduce epithelial permeability; and iii) broaden applicability in order to be used as potential drugs for CF therapy.

Multivariate latent curve models indicated that maternal stress remained high and stable with minimal individual variation in early childhood, but declined with significant individual variation in middle childhood. Maternal stress at the beginning of middle childhood was associated with earlier maternal stress, as well as children's behavioral problems and social skills.

This study characterized assays for urinary angiotensinogen (AGT), gremlin-1, and matrix metalloproteinase 7 (MMP-7), components of the RAS, BMP, and WNT pathways and examined their excretion in DKD. We measured urine AGT, gremlin-1, and MMP-7 in individuals with type 1 diabetes and prevalent DKD (n = 20) or longstanding (n = 61) or new-onset (n = 10) type 1 diabetes without DKD. These urine proteins were also quantified in type 2 DKD (n = 11) before and after treatment with candesartan. The utilized immunoassays had comparable inter- and intra-assay and intraindividual variation to assays used for urine albumin. Median (IQR) urine AGT concentrations were 226.0 (82.1, 550.3) and 13.0 (7.8, 20.0) μg/g creatinine in type 1 diabetes with and without DKD, respectively (P < 0.001). Median (IQR) urine gremlin-1 concentrations were 48.6 (14.2, 254.1) and 3.6 (1.7, 5.5) μg/g, respectively (P < 0.001). Median (IQR) urine MMP-7 concentrations were 6.0 (3.8, 10.5) and 1.0 (0.4, 2.9) μg/g creatinine, respectively (P < 0.001). Treatment with candesartan was associated with a reduction in median (IQR) urine AGT/creatinine from 23.5 (1.6, 105.1) to 2.0 (1.4, 13.7) μg/g, which did not reach statistical significance. Urine gremlin-1 and MMP-7 excretion did not decrease with candesartan. In conclusion, DKD is characterized by markedly elevated urine AGT, MMP-7, and gremlin-1. AGT decreased in response to RAS inhibition, suggesting that this marker reflects therapeutic response. Urinary components of the RAS, BMP, and WNT pathways may identify risk of DKD and aid development of novel therapeutics. ",

This study aimed to evaluate self-reported emotional and behavioral symptoms, parent-adolescent bonding and family functioning in clinically referred adolescent offspring of Croatian PTSD war veterans and determine the degree that parent-child bonding and family functioning contributed to adolescent behavior problems. Internalizing and externalizing behavior problems, parent-child bonding and family functioning were assessed in a sample of clinically referred Croatian PTSD veterans adolescent offspring (N = 122) and non-PTSD veteran adolescent offspring (N = 122) matched for age, sex, educational level, family income, parental employment status, ethnicity, and residential area. Youth Self-Report, Parental Bonding Instrument, Family Assessment Device were used. Adolescent offspring of PTSD veterans reported having significantly more internalizing and externalizing problems than non-PTSD veteran offspring, and also more difficulties in their family functioning, lower levels of maternal and paternal care, and more impaired mother-child and father-child bonding than control subjects. Internalizing symptoms were associated with family dysfunction, while externalizing symptoms were associated with paternal overcontrol/overprotection, and low maternal and paternal care. In conclusion, the increase in internalizing and externalizing symptoms as well as family and parental dysfunction among clinically referred adolescent offspring of PTSD veterans compared to their non-PTSD veteran counterparts indicates a need for early detection and interventions targeting both adolescent psychopathology and family relationships.

We are providing more options for patients and utilizing safer and more advanced technology, and remain grounded in a desire to continue to improve. In a description of the nurse's role during hemodialysis in 1950, responsibilities included technical aspects of the treatment, infection prevention, patient assessment and monitoring, documentation, medication administration, fluid management, patient education, and providing comfort and encouragement (Coleman & Merrill, 1952). Although the manner in which these roles are carried out has changed with time, the skills remain important today. Additionally, despite the technological differences throughout the last several decades, nephrology nursing has remained focused on humanizing the process for people with complex care needs, preserving the patient's dignity, teaching, supporting, and involving the patient and family in their care (Hoffart, 1986b). Throughout our historical journey, it is apparent that nephrology nurses have always been responsible for a significant amount (or majority) of the care of patients with kidney disease and that nursing care is much more than delivering a treatment (Lynaugh & Fairman, 1989). Nephrology nursing is grounded in patient and family-centered care based on both physiological and psychosocial needs. Nephrology nurses have touched every aspect of the kidney care community shaping the service, government, and product sectors. Nephrology nursing has been vital from the initial development years and continues to be an undeniable force in improving nephrology care to a patient population with very complex patient needs. Many changes have taken place since the inception of the ESRD program in July 1973. Advances in technology, demonstration projects, research, and reimbursement changes have reshaped the landscape of our care delivery models. In the same way, our knowledge of kidney disease has progressed substantially, resulting in improved diagnosis and treatment in an effort to reduce complications and improve outcomes for patients with ESRD.",

Good quality oocytes from healthy cows and from animals with a liver abnormality were matured and fertilized in vitro and then cultured to the blastocyst stage. On day 7 after fertilization, embryo cleavage and development were assessed. The concentrations of glucose, nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA), γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (γ-GTP), β-hydroxybutyrate (BHBA) and glutathione were measured in follicular fluids (FF). The proportion of good quality oocytes and the frequency of development to the blastocyst stage were lower in the liver anomaly group than those of the control group (P<0.05). The concentrations of γ-GTP and BHBA in the FF of the liver anomaly group were higher than those of the control group (P<0.05). The concentration of glutathione in the FF of the liver anomaly group was lower than that of the control group (P<0.05). Moreover, there was a negative correlation between these concentrations and the proportions of oocytes that developed to the blastocyst stage (P<0.05). Supplementation of the culture medium with γ-GTP or BHBA did not affect the rate of oocyte maturation but did cause a concentration-dependent reduction in the frequency of fertilized oocytes that developed to the blastocyst stage. Our findings indicate that the quality of oocytes and their potential for development are lower in cattle with liver disorders than those in healthy cattle; one possible cause may be the high concentration of γ-GTP and/or BHBA in their FF.",

We aim to determine nicotine-induced protein alterations in pancreatic cells, thereby revealing links between nicotine exposure and pancreatic disease. We compared the proteomic alterations induced by nicotine treatment in cultured pancreatic cells (mouse, rat, and human stellate cells and human duct cells) using MS-based techniques, specifically SDS-PAGE (gel) coupled with LC-MS/MS and spectral counting. We identified thousands of proteins in pancreatic cells, hundreds of which were identified exclusively or in higher abundance in either nicotine-treated or untreated cells. Interspecies comparisons of stellate cell proteins revealed several differentially abundant proteins (in nicotine treated versus untreated cells) common among the three species. Proteins appearing in all nicotine-treated stellate cells include amyloid beta (A4), procollagen type VI alpha 1, integral membrane protein 2B, and toll-interacting protein. Proteins that were differentially expressed upon nicotine treatment across cell lines were enriched in certain pathways, including nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, cytokine, and integrin signaling. At this analytical depth, we conclude that similar pathways are affected by nicotine, but alterations at the protein level among stellate cells of different species vary. Further interrogation of such pathways will lead to insights into the potential effect of nicotine on pancreatic cells at the biomolecular level and the extension of this concept to the effect of nicotine on pancreatic disease.",

The aim of the present study was to evaluate subclinical involvement of the central nervous system (CNS) in young patients with thalassemia intermedia, the use of nonimaging, noninvasive laboratory methods for detecting relevant abnormalities, and the frequency and possible correlation of coagulation abnormalities with CNS lesions. In this cross-sectional study, 24 young patients with thalassemia intermedia were evaluated (mean age 12 ± 4.6 years, range 4.5-20 years). Patients underwent neurological examination, inherited and acquired coagulation defect testing, as well as neurophysiologic and neuroimaging evaluation. Patients aged 6-16 also had intelligence scores measured. With regards to coagulation, a decrease in antithrombin III (ATIII), protein C and protein S activity was found in 4.1, 54.16 and 45.8% of patients, respectively. Increased D-dimers, as well as thrombin-antithrombin complex (TAT) and prothrombin fragment (F1 + 2) values were found in 12.5, 62.5 and 8.33% of patients, respectively. Heterozygosity and homozygosity for the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase mutation was found in 45.8 and 12.5% of patients, whereas heterozygosity for factor V Leiden and G20210FII was found in 8.33 and 12.5% of patients, respectively, with increased prevalence compared to Greek population. Neuroimaging evaluation was normal in all patients. Neurophysiologic evaluation revealed abnormal findings in 33.3% of patients on electroencephalogram (EEG), 16% on brain auditory-evoked potentials (BAEPs) and 4.12% on somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs). Visual-evoked potentials (VEPs) were normal in all patients. A statistically significant difference was found between low protein C values, as well as high platelet counts, with abnormal EEG findings (P = 0.004 and P = 0.039, respectively). Transcranial Doppler (TCD) measurements revealed increased peak systolic velocities in anterior and posterior cerebral arteries and in basilar artery in 57, 38 and 41% of patients, respectively, as compared to healthy population values. On the contrary, decreased mean velocities were found both on middle cerebral artery and pars terminalis of internal carotid examination in 28.5% of patients. Patients with pathological findings on TCD study had lower hematocrit (P = 0.049) and younger age (P = 0.001) than patients with normal measurements. With regards to intelligence scores, mean intelligence quotient (IQ) was 100 ± 19.1, with 11.7% of patients demonstrating IQ below 85. The study results confirm the early presence of hemostatic changes in patients with thalassemia intermedia. Additionally, they demonstrate subclinical CNS involvement starting at childhood. For such involvement detection, in addition to neuroimaging, neurophysiological and neuropsychological evaluation is warranted.",

SLC39A8 (ZIP8), a zinc transporter, is a major portal for Cd uptake into cells. We have recently identified that ZIP8 expression is under the transcriptional control of the NF-κB pathway. On the basis of this, we hypothesized that cigarette-smoke induced inflammation would increase ZIP8 expression in lung epithelia, thereby enhancing Cd uptake and cell toxicity. Herein we report that ZIP8 is a central mediator of Cd-mediated toxicity. TNF-α treatment of primary human lung epithelia and A549 cells induced ZIP8 expression, resulting in significantly higher cell death attributable to both apoptosis and necrosis following Cd exposure. Inhibition of the NF-κB pathway and ZIP8 expression significantly reduced cell toxicity. Zinc (Zn), a known cytoprotectant, prevented Cd-mediated cell toxicity via ZIP8 uptake. Consistent with cell culture findings, a significant increase in ZIP8 mRNA and protein expression was observed in the lung of chronic smokers compared with nonsmokers. From these studies, we conclude that ZIP8 expression is induced in lung epithelia in an NF-κB-dependent manner, thereby resulting in increased cell death in the presence of Cd. From this we contend that ZIP8 plays a critical role at the interface between micronutrient (Zn) metabolism and toxic metal exposure (Cd) in the lung microenvironment following cigarette smoke exposure. Furthermore, dietary Zn intake, or a lack thereof, may be a contributing factor in smoking-induced lung disease.",

At least some of these disturbances precede the overt expression of clinical symptoms and possibly are endophenotypes that could be used to diagnose an individual accurately as having a specific psychiatric disorder. More accurate diagnoses could significantly reduce the emotional and financial burden of disease by aiding clinicians in implementing appropriate treatments earlier and in tailoring treatment to the individual needs. Several methods, especially those based on machine learning, have been proposed that use anatomical brain measures and gold-standard diagnoses of participants to learn decision rules that classify a person automatically as having one disorder rather than another. We review the general principles and procedures for machine learning, particularly as applied to diagnostic classification, and then review the procedures that have thus far attempted to diagnose psychiatric illnesses automatically using anatomical measures of the brain. We discuss the strengths and limitations of extant procedures and note that the sensitivity and specificity of these procedures in their most successful implementations have approximated 90%. Although these methods have not yet been applied within clinical settings, they provide strong evidence that individual patients can be diagnosed accurately using the spatial pattern of disturbances across the brain.",

There is no uniform definition of EAD, and most definitions are based on arbitrary laboratory values. The aim of this study was to devise a definition of EAD that maximizes the predictive power for early death and graft failure. In this single-center, retrospective study, the ability of the international normalized ratio (INR), total bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), physiological Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score, and serum albumin levels within 7 days after LT to predict 90-day mortality or graft loss was compared with 2 previously used definitions of EAD: (1) peak total bilirubin level >10 mg/dL on days 2 to 7 and (2) either a total bilirubin level >10 mg/dL or an INR >1.6 on day 7 or an AST or alanine aminotransferase level >2000 IU/L within the first 7 days. Of 572 enrolled LT patients 38 died or required retransplantation within 90 days. Peak INR, total bilirubin level, AST levels, and MELD scores were predictors of 90-day graft failure. MELD score on postoperative day 5 was the best predictor with an area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.812 (95% CI: 0.739-0.886, P < 0.001). The best cutoff of MELD score on day 5 for predicting 90-day mortality or graft loss was 18.9. A MELD score >18.9 on postoperative day 5 was a better predictor than any other laboratory value or definition of EAD. This study has demonstrated that the MELD score can be a useful tool not only for pretransplant graft allocation but also for postoperative risk stratification.",

The test allows large number of samples to be typed and can also be used on stored samples. The assay correctly diagnosed 40 normal healthy individuals, 10 GT cases, 10 heterozygotes, 3 Bernard-Soulier syndrome cases and 2 type 3 GT cases. ELISA plates were stable at room temperature up to 3 weeks without any loss of activity. This novel and simple test can be widely used for heterozygote detection besides diagnosing GT cases without using a sophisticated flow cytometer or a platelet aggregometer and has wide applicability in countries like India where many of these cases remain undiagnosed due to the lack of diagnostic facilities.",

        "medline_abstract_text":"Coal workers' pneumoconiosis (CWP) is a chronic occupational lung disease caused by long-term inhalation of dust, which triggers inflammation of the alveoli, eventually resulting in irreversible lung damage. CWP ranges in severity from simple to advanced; the most severe form is progressive massive fibrosis (PMF). Advanced CWP is debilitating and often fatal. To prevent CWP, the Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969 established the current federal exposure limit for respirable dust in underground and surface coal mines. The Act also established a surveillance system for assessing prevalence of pneumoconiosis among underground coal miners, but this surveillance does not extend to surface coal miners. With enforcement of the exposure limit, the prevalence of CWP among underground coal miners declined from 11.2% during 1970-1974 to 2.0% during 1995-1999, before increasing unexpectedly in the last decade, particularly in Central Appalachia. Exposure to respirable dust is thought to be less in surface than underground coal miners. Although they comprise 48% of the coal mining workforce, surface coal miners have not been studied since 2002. To assess the prevalence, severity, and geographic distribution of pneumoconiosis among current surface coal miners, CDC obtained chest radiographs of 2,328 miners during 2010-2011 through the Coal Workers' Health Surveillance Program of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). Forty-six (2.0%) of 2,257 miners with >1 year of surface mining experience had CWP, including 37 who had never worked underground. Twelve (0.5%) had PMF, including nine who had never worked underground. A high proportion of the radiographs suggested silicosis, a disease caused by inhalation of crystalline silica. Surface coal mine operators should monitor worker exposures closely to ensure that both respirable dust and silica are below recommended levels to prevent CWP. Clinicians should be aware of the risk for advanced pneumoconiosis among surface coal miners, in addition to underground coal miners, to facilitate prompt disease identification and intervention.",

Anything that is both cheaper and better, but is not actually the dominant therapy, must have other drawbacks that prevent replacement of all dialysis treatment by transplantation. The barriers to universal transplantation as the therapy for end stage kidney disease include the economic limitations which, in some countries place transplantation, appropriately, at a lower priority than public health fundamentals such as clean water, sanitation and vaccination. Even in high income countries the technical challenges of surgery and the consequences of immunosuppression restrict the number of suitable recipients, but the major finite restrictions on kidney transplantation rates are the shortage of donated organs and the limited medical, surgical and nursing workforces with the required expertise. These problems have solutions which involve the full range of societal, professional, governmental and political environments.

Toll-like receptors are expressed on kupffer, endothelial, dendritic, biliary epithelial, hepatic stellate cells, and hepatocytes in the liver. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a central organelle of eukaryotic cells that exists as a place of lipid synthesis, protein folding and protein maturation. The ER is a major signal transduction organelle that senses and responds to changes in homeostasis. Conditions interfering with the function of the ER are collectively known as ER stress and can be induced by accumulation of unfolded protein aggregates or by excessive protein traffic as can occur during viral infection. The ability of ER stress to induce an inflammatory response is considered to play a role in disease pathogenesis. Importantly, ER stress is viewed as a contributor to the pathogenesis of liver diseases with evidence linking components of ER homeostasis as requirements for optimal Toll-like receptor function. In this context this review discusses the association of Toll-like receptors with ER stress. This is an emerging paradigm in the understanding of Toll-like receptor signalling which may have an underlying role in the pathogenesis of liver disease.",

        "medline_abstract_text":"A crucial problem in liver disease biology and a major obstacle to the development of new therapies is the inability to conduct mechanistic studies of live human hepatocytes. Liver tissue from patients is difficult to obtain and only reveals the disease aftermath, while animal models lack the significant genetic diversity of humans. Monogenic metabolic disorders of the liver are an ideal platform to explore the complex gene-environment interactions and the role of genetic variation in the onset and progression of liver disease. Human induced pluripotent stem cell (hIPSC) technology provides an unprecedented opportunity to generate live cellular models of disease for therapeutic candidate discovery and cell replacement therapy. In this review, we discuss the potential of hIPSC to increase our understanding of human disease with a focus on the current efforts to model metabolic diseases of the liver and to generate suitable populations of human hepatocytes for cell transplantation.",

Quite a few questions exist about this new treatment, and might be explored in nonhuman primate models. There are several reports on DBS of brain nucleus other than NAc in nonhuman primates. Therefore, we stereotactically implanted the electrodes into bilateral NAc under the guidance of MRI using a clinical Leksell stereotactic system in normal rhesus monkeys. NAc could be recognized as the area of continuity between the caudate nucleus and putamen in the coronal sections, which is beneath the internal capsule, and the gray matter nucleus between the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and anterior commissure in axial sections, which is medial to the putamen. NAc is mainly at a point 2.0-3.0 mm inferior, 3.0-4.0 mm anterior, and 4.5-5.5 mm lateral to the anterior commissure. The electrodes were implanted accurately and connected to an implantable pulse generator subcutaneously. After recovery from surgery, stimulation with a variety of parameters was trialed, and continuous stimulation at 90 μs, 3.5 V, 160, or 60 Hz was administered individually for 7 days. The behaviors and spontaneous locomotor activity of the animals did not change significantly during stimulation. This is the first report on DBS of NAc in nonhuman primates to the best of our knowledge. Bilateral electrical stimulation of NAc is a safe treatment. This model could be helpful in further studies on the clinical use of NAc stimulation for psychiatric disorders and for a better understanding of the functions of this nucleus.",

The sample consisted of 1321 students (48.7% boys) in Grade 1 to Grade 8 from northern Taiwan. Children's and adolescents' autistic-like social deficits were assessed using the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS), and their school and social adjustment (i.e., academic performance, negative attitudes toward schoolwork/teachers/classmates, behavioral problems at schools, negative peer relationships, and problems with peers) were assessed using the Social Adjustment Inventory for Children and Adolescents (SAICA). Both measures were completed by the mothers of the participants. Results from the linear mixed models demonstrated that autistic-like social deficits were associated with poor academic performance, negative attitudes toward schoolwork, teachers, and classmates, behavioral problems at schools, negative peer relationships, and problematic peer interactions. Moreover, gender and/or age moderated the associations between autistic-like social deficits and school and social adjustment problems. For example, autistic-like social deficits were more strongly related to negative school attitude, school social problems, and negative peer relationships in boys than in girls. Further, autistic-like social deficits were more strongly related to problems with peers in older girls than in older boys or younger children (regardless of gender). In conclusion, the present study suggests that autistic-like social deficits may place children and adolescents at increased risk for social and school maladjustment and that the extent of maladjustment may vary with the child's age and gender and the domains of adjustment under discussion.",

        "medline_abstract_text":"Some larval helminths alter the behavior of their intermediate hosts in ways that favor the predation of infected hosts, thus enhancing trophic transmission. Gammarids (Crustacea: Amphipoda) offer unique advantages for the study of the proximate factors mediating parasite-induced behavioral changes. Indeed, amphipods infected by distantly related worms (acanthocephalans, cestodes and trematodes) encysted in different microhabitats within their hosts (hemocoel, brain) present comparable, chronic, behavioral pathologies. In order to evaluate the potential connection between behavioral disturbances and immune responses in parasitized gammarids, this Review surveys the literature bearing on sensorimotor pathway dysfunctions in infected hosts, on the involvement of the neuromodulator serotonin in altered responses to environmental stimuli, and on systemic and neural innate immunity in arthropods. Hemocyte concentration and phenoloxidase activity associated with melanotic encapsulation are depressed in acanthocephalan-manipulated gammarids. However, other components of the arsenal deployed by crustaceans against pathogens have not yet been investigated in helminth-infected gammarids. Members of the Toll family of receptors, cytokines such as tumor necrosis factors (TNFs), and the free radical nitric oxide are all implicated in neuroimmune responses in crustaceans. Across animal phyla, these molecules and their neuroinflammatory signaling pathways are touted for their dual beneficial and deleterious properties. Thus, it is argued that neuroinflammation might mediate the biochemical events upstream of the serotonergic dysfunction observed in manipulated gammarids - a parsimonious hypothesis that could explain the common behavioral pathology induced by distantly related parasites, both hemocoelian and cerebral.",

From an ecological perspective, it can be expected that several factors in different systems (e.g., foster child, foster family, biological parents, and community) influence foster children's behavioral problems. Mainly, the influence of pre-care experiences, such as a history of maltreatment (Oswald, Heil, & Goldbeck, 2010), and in-care experiences, such as the number of out-of-home placements (Newton, Litrownik, & Landsverk, 2000), is investigated and confirmed. Although the body of research on predictive factors of foster children's behavioral problems is growing (McWey, Acock, & Porter, 2010), the possible influence of one important party is being neglected: biological fathers. This is remarkable given the central role of birth parents in family foster care (O'Donnell, 2001), and even more striking given the growing evidence of the influence of fathers on developmental outcomes of children (Lamb, 2010). This study reports on the involvement of birth fathers during foster care placement of their child and their association with the foster child's well-being. First, we review the literature on the influence of parents on foster children's mental health and discuss the limited research on fathers' involvement.

In addition, disorders which emerge during adolescence appear to be more enduring and serious than those with a later onset. Although these psychiatric conditions may appear different from each other in terms of their associated behavioral signs or symptoms, this review will argue that they involve common alterations in motivational processes or disturbances in reward processing, although the direction of such changes (hypersensitivity vs. hyposensitivity to reward) and the stage of processing affected (reward anticipation vs. receipt) may differ across broader groupings of disorder. Recent behavioral, neuropsychological and neuroimaging research on reward processing in children, adolescents, and adults with these conditions will be described and evaluated. In addition, this article will consider what these studies tell us about their etiology and highlight gaps in our knowledge base.

We performed an international double blind, cross-over trial in which 63 subjects with CF were studied while receiving either placeo or 500 mg oral clarithromycin twice daily for 5 months, with a 1-month wash-out. The primary efficacy end point was the change in lung function (FEV(1) and FVC) during the clarithromycin treatment period compared to placebo treatment. Secondary efficacy end points included; quality of life, number of pulmonary exacerbations, height and weight, sputum inflammatory mediator content, sputum transportability and surface properties, bacterial flora, nasal potential difference, and breath condensate. No significant difference in either the primary efficacy end point or any secondary end point was seen during the period of clarithromycin treatment compared to those seen during placebo administration.

Three pediatric patients with end-stage heart and liver disease who were considered low immunologic risk were included. All were managed by the same surgeon with a herein-described CHLT donor and recipient operation.

One-yr patient and graft survival rates were 100%. No patients experienced antibody-mediated or cell-mediated rejection. No patients had postoperative infections, and all patients were free of opportunistic infections at one-yr post-transplant. All patients were maintained safely on steroid-free immunosuppression. There were no intraoperative complications. In pediatric end-stage heart and liver disease patients with low immunologic risk, it is reasonable to proceed with en bloc CHLT so long as there is an experienced surgeon to perform the case.

Anything that is both cheaper and better, but is not actually the dominant therapy, must have other drawbacks that prevent replacement of all dialysis treatment by transplantation. The barriers to universal transplantation as the therapy for end-stage kidney disease include the economic limitations which in some countries place transplantation, appropriately, at a lower priority than public health fundamentals such as clean water, sanitation, and vaccination. Even in high-income countries, the technical challenges of surgery and the consequences of immunosuppression restrict the number of suitable recipients, but the major finite restrictions on kidney transplantation rates are the shortage of donated organs and the limited medical, surgical, and nursing workforces with the required expertise. These problems have solutions which involve the full range of societal, professional, governmental, and political environments.

Areas of good practice include the increased proportion of consultants who trained at a liver centre, the introduction of specific liver clinics and the widespread use of terlipressin and antibiotics for variceal bleeding. Areas of poor practice include limited access to alcohol psychiatry services and transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts (TIPS) and limited recording of outcome measures or patient databases.

The aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility of the MELD score-based system compared with the current Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) based-system and to suggest adequate cut-off to stratify waiting list mortality among Korean population. We included 788 adult patients listed in waiting list in Seoul National University Hospital from January 2008 to May 2011. The short-term survival until 6 months after registration was evaluated. Two hundred forty six (31.2%) patients underwent live donor liver transplantation and 353 (44.8%) patients were still waiting and 121 (15.4%) patients were dropped out due to death. Significant difference was observed when MELD score 24 and 31 were used as cut-off. Three-months survival of Status 2A was 70.2%. However, in Status 2A patients whose MELD score less than 24 (n=82), 86.6% of patients survived until 6 month. Furthermore, patients with high MELD score (≥31) among Status 2B group showed poorer survival rate (45.8%, 3-month) than Status 2A group. In conclusion, MELD score-based system can predict short term mortality better and select more number of high risk patients in Korean population. ",

We developed the rat gambling task (rGT) to investigate the neurobiology underlying complex decision-making processes. As in the Iowa Gambling task, the optimal strategy is to avoid choosing larger, riskier rewards and to instead favor options associated with smaller rewards but less loss and, ultimately, greater long-term gain. Given the demonstrated importance of the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and basolateral amygdala (BLA) in acquisition of the rGT and Iowa Gambling task, we used a contralateral disconnection lesion procedure to assess whether functional connectivity between these regions is necessary for optimal decision-making. Disrupting the OFC-BLA pathway retarded acquisition of the rGT. Devaluing the reinforcer by inducing sensory-specific satiety altered decision-making in control groups. In contrast, disconnected rats did not update their choice preference following reward devaluation, either when the devalued reward was still delivered or when animals needed to rely on stored representations of reward value (i.e., during extinction). However, all rats exhibited decreased premature responding and slower response latencies after satiety manipulations. Hence, disconnecting the OFC and BLA did not affect general behavioral changes caused by reduced motivation, but instead prevented alterations in the value of a specific reward from contributing appropriately to cost-benefit decision-making. These results highlight the role of the OFC-BLA pathway in the decision-making process and suggest that communication between these areas is vital for the appropriate assessment of reward value to influence choice.",

ALD is considered as a leading cause for a liver injury in modern dietary life. This study was aimed to investigate the effects of orally administrated citrus flavonoids (CFs) and their enzymatically modified ones (EM-CFs) to prevent ALD. Hesperidin and narirutin were extracted from peels of Citrus unshiu by ultra-sonication and purified further. These CFs were modified enzymatically through glycosylation and de-rhamnosylation by the actions of cyclodextrin glucanotransferase (CGTase) and hesperidinase, respectively. CFs and EM-CFs were fed to ICR mouse along with ethanol for 8 weeks, and changes in lipid contents, lipid peroxidation, GSH, antioxidant enzymes activity and proinflammatory cytokines in hepatic tissues were observed. Administration of CFs and EM-CFs along with alcohol significantly suppressed increases in prognostic parameters of a hepatocellular injury. Especially, EM-CFs fed groups maintained malondialdehyde, GSH levels and catalase activity in hepatic tissues close to those of the normal diet fed group. Abrupt increases in proinflammatory cytokines such as IκB-α, TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 in hepatocytes due to a chronic alcohol uptake were significantly suppressed by co-administration of EM-CFs. These results indicate that although the administration of CFs can alleviate ALD through preventing excessive lipid formation, protecting the antioxidant system and suppressing induction of inflammation in hepatocytes, their effectiveness can be further improved by glycosylation and de-rhamnosylation.",

The results showed that curcumin attenuated ethanol-induced histopathological changes of the liver and ameliorated the evident release of cellular alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). Ethanol exposure resulted in reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, malondialdehyde (MDA) elevation, glutathione (GSH) depletion and antioxidant defense system impairment, which were significantly reversed by curcumin treatment.

The cystic follicles showed a higher estrogen receptor α (ESR1) mRNA expression in the theca and granulosa and a lower estrogen receptor β (ESR2) expression. The cystic follicles also showed a strong expression of androgen receptor mRNA in the granulosa. No changes were observed in total progesterone receptor mRNA, but a very significant increase in the B isoform was found in the granulosa of the cystic follicles. The findings of the current study provide evidence that an altered steroid signaling system may be present in bovine follicular cysts, and we suggest that in conditions characterized by altered ovulation, such as COD, changes in the expression of ovarian steroid receptors could play a fundamental role in the pathogeny of this disease.",

We thus sought to optimize ex vivo LV gene transfer while preserving the hepatocyte integrity for subsequent transplantation into recipient animals. We found that culture media supplemented with epidermal growth factor (EGF) and, to a lesser extent, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) markedly improved transduction efficacy at various multiplicities of infection. Up to 87% of primary hepatocytes were transduced in the presence of 10 ng EGF, compared with ~30% in standard culture medium (SCMs). The increased number of transgene-expressing cells correlated with increased nuclear import and more integrated pro-viral copies per cell. Higher LV transduction efficacy was not associated with proliferation, as transduction capacity of gammaretroviral vectors remained low (<1%). Finally, we developed an LV transduction protocol for short-term (maximum 24 h) adherent hepatocyte cultures. LV-transduced hepatocytes showed liver repopulation capacities similar to freshly isolated hepatocytes in alb-uPA mouse recipients. Our findings highlight the importance of EGF for efficient LV transduction of primary hepatocytes in culture and should facilitate studies of LV gene transfer in mouse models of monogenetic liver disease.",

Intense bronchial neutrophilic inflammation and release of proteases and oxygen radicals perpetuate the vicious cycle and progressively damage the airways. In vitro studies suggest that CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR)-deficient airway epithelial cells display signalling abnormalities and aberrant intracellular processes which lead to transcription of inflammatory mediators. Several transcription factors, especially nuclear factor-κB, are activated. In addition, the accumulation of abnormally processed CFTR in the endoplasmic reticulum results in unfolded protein responses that trigger 'cell stress' and apoptosis leading to dysregulation of the epithelial cells and innate immune function in the lung, resulting in exaggerated and ineffective airway inflammation. Measuring airway inflammation is crucial for initiating treatment and monitoring its effect. No inflammatory biomarker predictive for the clinical course of CF lung disease is currently known, although neutrophil elastase seems to correlate with lung function decline. CF animal models mimicking human lung disease may provide an important insight into the pathogenesis of lung inflammation in CF and identify new therapeutic targets. ",

Preference for live coral declined from 49.4% to 23.3% and movement between habitats declined from 2.1 to 0.4 times between 20 mg l⁻¹ and 30 mg l⁻¹, suggesting a sediment threshold for behavioral changes. Inshore areas of the Great Barrier Reef, P. moluccensis may encounter sub-optimal conditions between 8% and 53% of the time. Changes in these vital processes may have long-term effects on the persistence of populations, particularly as habitat loss on coral reefs increases.",

To be useful in treating or preventing illness, research studies must provide valid information about the causes of illness, because only by targeting those causes can we prevent or counter their effects in a truly rational way. Until now, the discovery of interventions has largely been by serendipity, yielding medications and behavioral interventions that produce too little therapeutic response, in too few people, and with too many side effects. The selection of which specific intervention to use for which child is based on trial-and-error guesswork and the personal preferences and idiosyncrasies of the treating clinician, with little or no empirical support, and at great cost to children, families, and health care systems. Guesswork in treatment will decline only when we have more detailed knowledge of the differing causal pathways that produce differing subtypes of the same disease phenotype. Identifying more homogeneous subtypes of disease that have more uniform natural histories and treatment responses will permit development of more genuinely rational and individualized interventions, or more truly personalized medicine (Insel, 2009). Identifying causal pathways in human disease, however, is especially challenging because the classic method of experimental investigation - isolating and manipulating at will a variable that is hypothesized to exert a causal influence on the illness in order to understand its effects on other variables - is not possible when studying the causes of human illness, for obvious ethical reasons. We are therefore left with a variety of methods for identifying probable causal pathways in human illness, all of which have varying strengths and limitations in the weight of evidence that they provide that a variable has a true causal influence on the disorder.

In this review, we summarize recent advances regarding the origins and roles of various inflammatory components in ALD. Metabolism of ethanol generates a number of metabolites, including acetate, reactive oxygen species, acetaldehyde, and epigenetic changes, that can induce inflammatory responses. Alcohol and its metabolites can also initiate and aggravate inflammatory conditions by promoting gut leakiness of microbial products, by sensitizing immune cells to stimulation, and by activating innate immune pathways, such as complement. Chronic alcohol consumption also sensitizes nonimmune cells, e.g., hepatocytes, to inflammatory signals and impairs their ability to respond to protective signals. Based on these advances, a number of inflammatory targets have been identified with potential for therapeutic intervention in ALD, presenting new opportunities and challenges for translational research.",

Since CsA is characterised by its low water solubility, the development of a topical ophthalmic formulation represents an interesting pharmaceutical question. In the present study, two different strategies to address this challenge were studied and compared: (i) a water-soluble CsA prodrug formulated within an aqueous solution and (ii) a CsA oil-in-water emulsion (Restasis, Allergan Inc., Irvine, CA). First, the prodrug formulation was shown to have an excellent ocular tolerance as well as no influence on the basal tear production; maintaining the ocular surface properties remained unchanged. Then, in order to allow in vivo investigations, a specific analytical method based on ultra high pressure liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (UHPLC-MS/MS) was developed and optimised to quantify CsA in ocular tissues and fluids. The CsA ocular kinetics in lachrymal fluid for both formulations were found to be similar between 15 min and 48 h. The CsA ocular distribution study evidenced the ability of the prodrug formulation to penetrate into the eye, achieving therapeutically active CsA levels in tissues of both the anterior and posterior segments. In addition, the detailed analysis of the in vivo data using a bicompartmental model pointed out a higher bioavailability and lower elimination rate for CsA when it is generated from the prodrug than after direct application as an emulsion. The interesting in vivo properties displayed by the prodrug solution make it a safe and suitable option for the treatment of DED.",

Histological evaluation of the DI revealed signs of inflammation from day 5, which progressively increased in severity and affected more fish with increasing SBM exposure time. The expression profiles of 16 genes were analyzed by quantitative PCR. The pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin 17A (IL-17A), IL-1β, interferon α (IFNα) and IFNγ, as well as IL-17A receptor, T-cell receptor γ (TCRγ), cluster of differentiation 4α (CD4α), CD8β, transforming growth factor β (TGFβ), trypsin, protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR2) and myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88) were significantly up-regulated during early and/or late inflammation stages, whereas interferon-γ-inducible lysosomal thiol reductase (GILT) was downregulated. Up-regulation of TCRγ from day seven suggests proliferation of intraepithelial γδ T cells.

Our analysis was based on United Network for Organ Sharing data of patients with ESLD on the waiting list between January 2006 and June 2009. We compared six allocation models to MELD. Two models were based on reweighting the variables used by MELD: an \"updated\" MELD, and ReFit MELD. Four models also included serum sodium: MESO, MeldNa, UKELD, and ReFit MELDNa. We estimated that UKELD and the updated MELD would result in significantly fewer lives saved. There were no significant differences between the other models. Our new approach can supplement standard methods to provide insight into the relative performance of liver allocation models in reducing waiting list mortality. Our analysis suggests that UKELD and the updated MELD score would not be optimal for reducing waiting list mortality in the United States.",

In the present study, a Muc5ac knockout (KO) mouse model was subject to various physiological measurements as compared to its wide-type (WT) control. Interestingly, when KO mice were compared to WT mice, the mean tear break up time (TBUT) values were significantly lower and corneal fluorescein staining scores were significantly higher. But the tear volume was not changed. Despite the lack of Muc5ac expression in the conjunctiva of KO mice, Muc5b expression was significantly increased in these mice. Corneal opacification, varying in location and severity, was found in a few KO mice but not in WT mice. The present results suggest a significant difference in the quality, but not the quantity, of tear fluid in the KO mice compared to WT mice. Dry eye disease is multifactorial and therefore further evaluation of the varying components of the tear film, lacrimal unit and corneal structure of these KO mice may help elucidate the role of mucins in dry eye disease. Because Muc5ac knockout mice have clinical features of dry eye, this mouse model will be extremely useful for further studies regarding the pathophysiology of the ocular surface in dry eye in humans.",

We recently described the development of the disease from initial infection until manifestation of clinical disease signs in rainbow trout held at 2 water temperatures, 12 and 18°C. The aim of the present study is to investigate whether (1) infected fish surviving the clinical phase would recover from renal pathological changes, (2) whether they would be able to reduce the parasite load in the kidneys, and (3) whether water temperatures would influence renal recovery and parasite clearance. At 18°C, fish showed a gradual recovery of normal kidney morphology which was associated with a decline in parasite numbers and infection prevalence. Fish kept at 12°C initially showed an enhancement of kidney lesions before recovery of normal kidney morphology took place. The decrease in renal parasite load was retarded compared to 18°C. The results from the present study provide evidence that rainbow trout surviving the clinical phase of PKD are able to (1) fully restore renal structure, and (2) significantly reduce renal parasite loads, although 100% clearance was not achieved within the experimental period of this study.

Anything that is both cheaper and better, but is not actually the dominant therapy, must have other drawbacks that prevent replacement of all dialysis treatment by transplantation. The barriers to universal transplantation as the therapy for end stage kidney disease include the economic limitations which, in some countries place transplantation, appropriately, at a lower priority than public health fundamentals such as clean water, sanitation and vaccination. Even in high income countries the technical challenges of surgery and the consequences of immunosuppression restrict the number of suitable recipients, but the major finite restrictions on kidney transplantation rates are the shortage of donated organs and the limited medical, surgical and nursing workforces with the required expertise. These problems have solutions which involve the full range of societal, professional, governmental and political environments.

Various studies have demonstrated delayed neurotoxic effects in adult mammals after acute CPF exposure. This pesticide induces oxidative stress and neuronal damage, which suggests a possible relationship between CPF exposure and Alzheimer's disease (AD). In the present study, we examined in a mice model of AD, long-term changes in the behavior and brain levels of amyloid β after acute CPF exposure. Fifty mg/kg of CPF were subcutaneously injected to Tg2576 (Tg) mice carrying the Swedish amyloid-β protein precursor (AβPP) mutation for AD. General status, body weight, acetyl cholinesterase (AChE) inhibition, and behavioral changes were assessed. Amyloid β fragment (1-40 and 1-42) levels were also measured in the cortical and hippocampal brain regions. A significant and transient decrease in body weight was observed 72 hr after treatment, while no autonomic effects were noted. Motor activity was decreased in Tg mice seven months after CPF treatment. Acquisition learning in a water maze task was not affected, but retention was ameliorated in CPF-exposed Tg mice. Amyloid β levels increased in the brains of treated Tg mice eight months after CPF exposure. The results of this study show that some behavioral changes persisted or emerged months after acute CPF exposure, while amyloid β levels increased. These findings raise concern about the risk of developing neurodegenerative diseases following moderate exposure to CPF in vulnerable subjects.",

Anything that is both cheaper and better, but is not actually the dominant therapy, must have other drawbacks that prevent replacement of all dialysis treatment by transplantation. The barriers to universal transplantation as the therapy for end-stage kidney disease include the economic limitations which, in some countries, place transplantation, appropriately, at a lower priority than public health fundamentals such as clean water, sanitation and vaccination. Even in high-income countries, the technical challenges of surgery and the consequences of immunosuppression restrict the number of suitable recipients, but the major finite restrictions on kidney transplantation rates are the shortage of donated organs and the limited medical, surgical and nursing workforces with the required expertise. These problems have solutions which involve the full range of societal, professional, governmental and political environments. World Kidney Day is a call to deliver transplantation therapy to the one million people a year who have a right to benefit. ",

Previous studies have shown that the dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) plays a critical role in working memory and that behavioral training of working memory can alter the activity of DLPFC. However, it is unclear whether the activation in the DLPFC can be self-regulated and whether any self-regulation can affect working memory behavior. The recently emerged real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (rtfMRI) technique enables the individuals to acquire self-control of localized brain activation, potentially inducing desirable behavioral changes. In the present study, we employed the rtfMRI technique to train subjects to up-regulate the activation in the left DLPFC, which is linked to verbal working memory. After two rtfMRI training sessions, activation in the left DLPFC was significantly increased, whereas the control group that received sham feedback did not show any increase in DLPFC activation. Pre- and post-training behavioral tests indicated that performance of the digit span and letter memory task was significantly improved in the experimental group. Between-group comparison of behavioral changes showed that the increase of digit span in the experimental group was significantly greater than that in the control group. These findings provide preliminary evidence that working memory performance can be improved through learned regulation of activation in associated brain regions using rtfMRI. ",

At the Australian Synchrotron, the Imaging and Medical beamline (IMBL) is well equipped for PB-PCXI, combining high flux and coherence with a beam size sufficient to image large animals, such as sheep, due to a wiggler source and source-to-sample distances of over 137 m. This study aimed to measure the capabilities of PB-PCXI on IMBL for imaging small animal lungs to study lung disease. The feasibility of combining this technique with computed tomography for three-dimensional imaging and X-ray velocimetry for studies of airflow and non-invasive lung function testing was also investigated. Detailed analysis of the role of the effective source size and sample-to-detector distance on lung image contrast was undertaken as well as phase retrieval for sample volume analysis. Results showed that PB-PCXI of lung phantoms and mouse lungs produced high-contrast images, with successful computed tomography and velocimetry also being carried out, suggesting that live animal lung imaging will also be feasible at the IMBL.

It is not known if there are any changes in the chemical coding patterns of these neurons during porcine proliferative enteropathy (PE). To answer this question, juvenile Large White Polish pigs with clinically diagnosed Lawsonia intracellularis infection (PE; n = 3) and a group of uninfected controls (C; n = 3) were compared. The retrograde tracer fast blue (FB) was injected into the descending colons of all animals and then tissue comprising IMGs from both groups was processed for double-labeling immunofluorescence with calbindin-D28k (CB) in combination with either tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), neuropeptide Y (NPY), somatostatin (SOM), vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), nitric oxide synthase, Leu-enkephalin, substance P, vesicular acetylcholine transporter, galanin, or pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide. Immunohistochemistry revealed changes in the chemical coding pattern of calbindin-immunoreactive neurons in the inferior mesenteric ganglia of the pig. In control animals, FB/CB-positive neurons were immunoreactive to TH, NPY, SOM, and VIP. In the experimental group, TH-expressing neurons were unaffected, NPY-expressing neurons were increased, whereas the number of neurons immunoreactive to SOM or VIP was reduced. Changes in chemical coding of CB neurons during PE may play an important role in adaptation of these IMG cells under pathological conditions.",

        "medline_abstract_text":"Stress-related psychiatric disorders are more prevalent in women than men. As hypersecretion of the stress neuromediator, corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) has been implicated in these disorders, sex differences in CRF sensitivity could underlie this disparity. Hyperarousal is a core symptom that is shared by stress-related disorders and this has been attributed to CRF regulation of the locus ceruleus (LC)-norepinephrine arousal system. We recently identified sex differences in CRF(1) receptor (CRF(1)) signaling and trafficking that render LC neurons of female rats more sensitive to CRF and potentially less able to adapt to excess CRF compared with male rats. The present study used a genetic model of CRF overexpression to test the hypothesis that females would be more vulnerable to LC dysregulation by conditions of excess CRF. In both male and female CRF overexpressing (CRF-OE) mice, the LC was more densely innervated by CRF compared with wild-type controls. Despite the equally dense CRF innervation of the LC in male and female CRF-OE mice, LC discharge rates recorded in slices in vitro were selectively elevated in female CRF-OE mice. Immunoelectron microscopy revealed that this sex difference resulted from differential CRF(1) trafficking. In male CRF-OE mice, CRF(1) immunolabeling was prominent in the cytoplasm of LC neurons, indicative of internalization, a process that would protect cells from excessive CRF. However, in female CRF-OE mice, CRF(1) labeling was more prominent on the plasma membrane, suggesting that the compensatory response of internalization was compromised. Together, the findings suggest that the LC-norepinephrine system of females will be particularly affected by conditions resulting in elevated CRF because of differences in receptor trafficking. As excessive LC activation has been implicated in the arousal components of stress-related psychiatric disorders, this may be a cellular mechanism that contributes to the increased incidence of these disorders in females.",

Whilst some of the essential pathways have a well understood function, such as bile biosynthesis and transport, the role of the others is not known. Here we report the findings of a clinical, biochemical and molecular study of a family with three patients affected with a severe infantile cholestatic disease. A novel homozygous frameshift germline mutation (c.587delG) in the AKR1D1 gene; which encodes the enzyme Δ 4-3-oxosteroid 5β-reductase that is required for synthesis of primary bile acids and is crucial for establishment of normal bile flow, was found in all 3 patients. Although the initial bile acid analysis was inconclusive, subsequent testing confirmed the diagnosis of a bile acid biogenesis disorder. An additional novel homozygous frameshift mutation (c.3391delC) was detected in SKIV2L in one of the patients. SKIV2L encodes a homologue of a yeast ski2 protein proposed to be involved in RNA processing and mutations in SKIV2L were recently described in patients with Tricohepatoenteric syndrome (THES). A combination of autozygosity mapping and whole-exome-sequencing allowed the identification of causal mutations in this family with a complex liver phenotype. Although the initial 2 affected cousins died in the first year of life, accurate diagnosis and management of the youngest patient led to successful treatment of the liver disease and disease-free survival.",

In the present in vivo study, we assessed chronic neuroinflammation, neuronal cell loss, cell proliferation and neuronal differentiation in specific brain regions of adult Sprague-Dawley male rats following controlled cortical impact model of moderate TBI with or without exposure to PTSD. Eight weeks post-TBI, stereology-based histological analyses revealed no significant differences between sham and PTSD alone treatment across all brain regions examined, whereas significant exacerbation of OX6-positive activated microglial cells in the striatum, thalamus, and cerebral peduncle, but not cerebellum, in animals that received TBI alone and combined TBI-PTSD compared with PTSD alone and sham treatment. Additional immunohistochemical results revealed a significant loss of CA3 pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus of TBI alone and TBI-PTSD compared to PTSD alone and sham treatment. Further examination of neurogenic niches revealed a significant downregulation of Ki67-positive proliferating cells, but not DCX-positive neuronally migrating cells in the neurogenic subgranular zone and subventricular zone for both TBI alone and TBI-PTSD compared to PTSD alone and sham treatment. Comparisons of levels of neuroinflammation and neurogenesis between TBI alone and TBI+PTSD revealed that PTSD did not exacerbate the neuropathological hallmarks of TBI. These results indicate a progressive deterioration of the TBI brain, which, under the conditions of the present approach, was not intensified by PTSD, at least within our time window and within the examined areas of the brain. Although the PTSD manipulation employed here did not exacerbate the pathological effects of TBI, the observed long-term inflammation and suppressed cell proliferation may evolve into more severe neurodegenerative diseases and psychiatric disorders currently being recognized in traumatized TBI patients.

Methods. This include retrospective study of 189 biopsies of 185 liver masses for cytological or histological analysis. Patients were subdivided into two groups. Group 1 consisted of 124 suspected metastasis. Group 2 consisted of 61 suspected primary neoplasms. Biopsies were considered positive or equivocal. In equivocal cases, special stains were performed. In Group 2, cases were classified by contrast CT or MRI as to (I) classic HCC, (II) infiltrated HCC, or (Ill) equivocal. Results. Definitive diagnosis was obtained in 117/124 masses (94%) in Group 1, 48/61 masses (79%) in Group 2, and (Ill) equivocal 13 cases in Group II. In two equivocal cases in which special stains were performed, they were reclassified as HCC. In 8/13 cases, CT findings were consistent with HCC. Conclusion. Liver biopsies are useful in obtaining a definitive diagnosis of suspected metastatic liver disease. Biopsy results are less reliable in patients with suspected primary liver tumors. In these situations, strategies can include basing treatment on imaging criteria or use of newer special pathological stains. Advances in Knowledge. Use of newer special immunological stains improves accuracy in definitive diagnosis of primary liver tumors. ",

While trying to control this shortage, there is a lot of discussion about the transplantation for malignant liver disease. In our opinion, the focus in this topic should be the utilisation and expansion of the donor pool. There are many logistic and medical aspects which could be optimised. Furthermore, there are open questions in public and political discussions (up to the revision of the transplantation law) which should be improved for the purpose of the waiting list patients. ",

        "medline_abstract_text":"Although alcoholic liver disease is clinically well described, the molecular basis for alcohol-induced hepatotoxicity is not well understood. Previously, we found that alcohol exposure led to increased microtubule acetylation and stability in polarized, hepatic WIF-B cells and in livers from ethanol-fed rats. Because microtubules are known to regulate transcription factor nuclear translocation and dynamic microtubules are required for translocation of at least a subset of these factors, we examined whether alcohol-induced microtubule acetylation and stability impair nuclear translocation. We examined nuclear delivery of factors representing the two mechanisms by which microtubules regulate translocation. To represent factors that undergo directed delivery, we examined growth hormone-induced STAT5B translocation and IL-6-induced STAT3 translocation. To represent factors that are sequestered in the cytoplasm by microtubule attachment until ligand activation, we examined transforming growth factor-β-induced Smad2/3 translocation. We found that ethanol exposure selectively impaired translocation of the STATs, but not Smad2/3. STAT5B delivery was decreased to a similar extent by addition of taxol (a microtubule-stabilizing drug) or trichostatin A (a deacetylase inhibitor), agents that promote microtubule acetylation in the absence of alcohol. Thus the alcohol-induced impairment of STAT nuclear translocation can be explained by increased microtubule acetylation and stability. Only ethanol treatment impaired STAT5B activation, indicating that microtubules are not important for its activation by Jak2. Furthermore, nuclear exit was not changed in treated cells, indicating that this process is also independent of microtubule acetylation and stability. Together, these results raise the exciting possibility that deacetylase agonists may be effective therapeutics for the treatment of alcoholic liver disease.",

Serum immunomolecules from 42 patients with MAC lung disease were assayed comparatively using an array-based system according to (i) patients with MAC lung disease at the time of diagnosis versus healthy controls and (ii) alterations after 12 months of antibiotic therapy in the MAC lung disease group. In addition, cytokine analyses were performed to determine whether cytokine responses were associated specifically with the disease phenotype, treatment outcome and aetiological agent. Notably, the serum concentrations of type 1 cytokine-associated molecules, such as CD40L, interferon (IFN)-γ, interleukin (IL)-8 and IL-23, were decreased significantly in patients at the time of diagnosis, suggesting that these molecules may serve as indicators of host susceptibility to MAC disease. Although the overall serum level of T helper type 1 (Th1)-related molecules, such as CD40L and IFN-γ, was restored after treatment, Th17-related cytokines, such as IL-17 and IL-23, were down-regulated significantly at 12 months post-treatment compared to pretreatment. Furthermore, these cytokine patterns differed among patient subgroups. Decreased serum concentrations of IL-17 and/or IL-23 were associated with failure of sputum conversion, the fibrocavitary disease phenotype and M. intracellulare lung disease. Thus, the reciprocal balance between Th1 and Th17 immunity during antibiotic therapy for MAC lung disease is critical for dictating the treatment response. In conclusion, a low level of Th1-related immunomolecules may perpetuate MAC lung disease, and the serum concentrations of Th17-related cytokines can reflect the treatment outcome, disease phenotype and aetiological agent.

In the male gonad, the most abundant protein that builds gap junctions is connexin 43 (Cx43, GJA1). Specific knock-out of Sertoli cells (SCCx43KO(-/-)) results in an impaired spermatogenesis up to the Sertoli cell only syndrome. The aim of this study was to compare the testicular expression pattern of the androgen receptor (AR) in wild type (WT) and SCCx43KO(-/-) mice. In both WT and SCCx43KO(-/-) testes, the AR staining was restricted to the nuclei of Sertoli, Leydig, and peritubular cells. However, the staining intensity varied between control and mutant mice. In the latter, the AR expression depended on the level of the seminiferous tubule impairment. In tubules with qualitatively normal spermatogenesis, the AR protein expression was similar to that observed in the testes of WT mice. Conversely, seminiferous tubules with an arrest of spermatogenesis at the level of spermatogonial or spermatocyte phase expressed the AR at a lower intensity. In Sertoli cell only tubules (no germ cells in the tubules), the AR immunoreaction was mainly weak or undetectable. Moreover, AR staining was lower in Sertoli and Leydig cells (p<0.001 and p<0.05, respectively) of SCCx43KO(-/-) mice compared to WT mice, as revealed by a semiquantitative analysis. In conclusion, the deletion of Cx43 leads to a partial disruption of the AR signaling pathway, indicating a possible reason for the observed impaired spermatogenesis.",

However, it has been extremely difficult to detect and assess such causality particularly at low exposure levels. To address this question, we here investigated higher brain function in mice exposed to dioxin in utero and via lactation by using our recently developed automated behavioral flexibility test and immunohistochemistry of neuronal activation markers Arc, at the 14 brain areas. Pregnant C57BL/6 mice were given orally a low dose of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) at a dose of either 0, 0.6 or 3.0 µg/kg on gestation day 12.5. When the pups reached adulthood, they were group-housed in IntelliCage to assess their behavior. As a result, the offspring born to dams exposed to 0.6 µg TCDD/kg were shown to have behavioral inflexibility, compulsive repetitive behavior, and dramatically lowered competitive dominance. In these mice, immunohistochemistry of Arc exhibited the signs of hypoactivation of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and hyperactivation of the amygdala. Intriguingly, mice exposed to 3.0 µg/kg were hardly affected in both the behavioral and neuronal activation indices, indicating that the robust, non-monotonic dose-response relationship. In conclusion, this study showed for the first time that perinatal exposure to a low dose of TCDD in mice develops executive function deficits and social behavioral abnormality accompanied with the signs of imbalanced mPFC-amygdala activation.",

This is the first demonstration that lung development in a tetrapod can be inhibited by environmental factors and that a tetrapod that relies significantly on lung respiration under unstressed conditions can be raised to forego this function without adverse effects. This study compared lung development in untreated, air-deprived (AD) and air-restored (AR) tadpoles and frogs using whole mounts, histology, BrdU labeling of cell division and antibody staining of smooth muscle actin. We also examined the relationship of swimming and breathing behaviors to lung recovery in AR animals. Inhibition and recovery of lung development occurred at the stage of lung inflation. Lung recovery in AR tadpoles occurred at a predictable and rapid rate and correlated with changes in swimming and breathing behavior. It thus presents a new experimental model for investigating the role of mechanical forces in lung development. Lung recovery in AR frogs was unpredictable and did not correlate with behavioral changes. Its low frequency of occurrence could be attributed to developmental, physical and behavioral changes, the effects of which increase with size and age. Plasticity of lung inflation at tadpole stages and loss of plasticity at postmetamorphic stages offer new insights into the role of developmental plasticity in amphibian lung loss and life history evolution.

Anything that is both cheaper and better, but is not actually the dominant therapy, must have other drawbacks that prevent replacement of all dialysis treatment by transplantation. The barriers to universal transplantation as the therapy for end-stage kidney disease include the economic limitations that in some countries place transplantation, appropriately, at a lower priority than public health fundamentals such as clean water, sanitation and vaccination. Even in high-income countries, the technical challenges of surgery and the consequences of immunosuppression restrict the number of suitable recipients, but the major finite restrictions on kidney transplantation rates are the shortage of donated organs and the limited medical, surgical and nursing workforces with the required expertise.

The clinicopathologic and molecular evidence obtained from the comparative study of the aforementioned conditions indicate that Hürthle cell appearance represents a phenotype that is superimposed on the genotypic and conventional histopathologic features of the tumors. Hürthle cell tumors differ from their non-Hürthle counterparts regarding the prevalence of large deletions of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), mutations of mtDNA genes coding for oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) proteins (namely mutations of complex I subunit genes) and mutations of nuclear genes coding also for mitochondrial OXPHOS proteins. Such mitochondrial alterations lead to energy production defects in Hürthle cell tumors; the increased proliferation of mitochondria may reflect a compensatory mechanism for such defects and is associated with the overexpression of factors involved in mitochondrial biogenesis. The mitochondrial abnormalities are also thought to play a major role in the predisposition for necrosis instead of apoptosis which seems to be blocked in most Hürthle cell tumors. Finally, the results obtained in experimental models using cybrid cell lines and the data obtained from histopathologic and molecular studies of familial Hürthle cell tumors are used, together with the aforementioned genetic and epigenetic alterations, to progress in the understanding of the mechanisms through which mitochondrial abnormalities may be involved in the different steps of thyroid carcinogenesis, from tumor initiation to metastization.",

Only the short memory behavior (distance between goal box and first hole investigated) of male mice congenitally infected with T. gondii was significantly different (P < 0.05) from that of uninfected control males at both 4 and 8 wk by using the Barnes maze test. The other parameters examined in the latter test, i.e., functional observational battery tests, virtual cliff, visual placement, and activity tests, were not significantly different (P > 0.05) at 4 and 8 wk.

A cell-based model has improved our understanding of in vivo mechanisms of hemostasis and the basis of the bleeding tendency in hemophilia. Bypassing agents do not restore the normal pathways of hemostasis in hemophilia, but rather boost thrombin generation in spite of a lack of platelet surface FVIIIa-FIXa ('tenase') activity. Thus, the common clinical laboratory coagulation assays do not reflect the clinically relevant hemostatic activity of bypassing agents, and no validated assay is available with which to measure the in vivo efficacy of these agents or predict individual patient responses to treatment. Global hemostasis assays measuring overall coagulation capacity have potential for assessment of the effects of bypassing agents. This review will focus on the mechanisms of clotting and their relationship to understanding the mechanisms of action of the bypassing agents in vivo and the methodologies that are emerging to monitor the clinical efficacy of bypassing agent therapy.",

It is an emerging threat to wild brown trout Salmo trutta fario populations in Switzerland. Here we examined (1) how PKD prevalence and pathology in young-of-the-year (YOY) brown trout relate to water temperature, (2) whether wild brown trout can completely recover from T. bryosalmonae-induced renal lesions and eliminate T. bryosalmonae over the winter months, and (3) whether this rate and/or extent of the recovery is influenced by concurrent infection. A longitudinal field study on a wild brown trout cohort was conducted over 16 mo. YOY and age 1+ fish were sampled from 7 different field sites with various temperature regimes, and monitored for infection with T. bryosalmonae and the nematode Raphidascaris acus. T. bryosamonae was detectable in brown trout YOY from all sampling sites, with similar renal pathology, independent of water temperature. During winter months, recovery was mainly influenced by the presence or absence of concurrent infection with R. acus larvae. While brown trout without R. acus regenerated completely, concurrently infected brown trout showed incomplete recovery, with chronic renal lesions and incomplete translocation of T. bryosalmonae from the renal interstitium into the tubular lumen. Water temperature seemed to influence complete excretion of T. bryosalmonae, with spores remaining in trout from summer-warm rivers, but absent in trout from summer-cool rivers. In the following summer months, we found PKD infections in 1+ brown trout from all investigated river sites. The pathological lesions indicated a re-infection rather than a proliferation of remaining T. bryosalmonae. However, disease prevalence in 1+ trout was lower than in YOY.",

This type of plasticity involves processes ranging from neurite outgrowth/retraction or dendritic spine remodeling, to the incorporation of new neurons to the established circuitry. However, the study of how these structural changes take place has been focused mainly on excitatory neurons, while little attention has been paid to interneurons. The exploration of these plastic phenomena in interneurons is very important, not only for our knowledge of CNS physiology, but also for understanding better the etiology of different psychiatric and neurological disorders in which alterations in the structure and connectivity of inhibitory networks have been described. Here we review recent work on the structural remodeling of interneurons in the adult brain, both in basal conditions and after chronic stress or sensory deprivation. We also describe studies from our laboratory and others on the putative mediators of this interneuronal structural plasticity, focusing on the polysialylated form of the neural cell adhesion molecule (PSA-NCAM). This molecule is expressed by some interneurons in the adult CNS and, through its anti-adhesive and insulating properties, may participate in the remodeling of their structure. Finally, we review recent findings on the possible implication of PSA-NCAM on the remodeling of inhibitory neurons in certain psychiatric disorders and their treatments.",

Social learning of fear is expected to be especially advantageous for survival. However, disruption of social development in early life can impair social cognition and might also be expected to disrupt social learning. Social isolation during a critical period of adolescence disrupts social development. The purpose of this study was to determine whether disruption of social development through post-weaning social isolation leads to impairments of social fear learning. Rats were reared in isolation or pair-housed from immediately post-weaning, for 3 weeks. Social fear learning in rats was acquired by observation of tone-footshock pairings administered to a conspecific. Isolation-reared rats displayed less conditioned freezing than pair-housed rats when tested the next day. This reduction of conditioned freezing was correlated with conspecific-oriented behaviors during conditioning, was measured despite similarities in demonstrator behaviors, and occurred despite a manipulation that equalized freezing during conditioning between the pair-housed and isolation-reared rats. The results could not be explained by abnormal sensitization to a repeated tone or deficits in freezing or direct fear conditioning. These results demonstrate that observational fear conditioning is impaired by social isolation, and provide a model to study impaired social affective learning. Impaired social cognition, manifested as inability to recognize or appropriately interpret social cues, is a symptom of several psychiatric disorders. Better understanding of the mechanisms of impaired social fear learning can lead to novel treatments for social cognition symptoms of psychiatric disorders.",

        "medline_abstract_text":"Parenteral nutrition (PN) is a life-saving nutritional support for a large population of hospitalized infants, and lipids make a substantial contribution to their energy and essential fatty acid (FA) needs. A challenge in the care of these infants is that their metabolic needs require prolonged PN support that increases the risk of PN-associated liver disease (PNALD). In recent years, the emergence of new parenteral lipid emulsions containing different source lipids and FA profiles has created nutritional alternatives to the first-generation, soybean oil-based lipid emulsion Intralipid. The limited U.S. introduction of the new-generation fish-oil emulsion Omegaven has generated promising results in infants with PNALD and spawned a renewed interest in how PN and lipid emulsions, in particular, contribute to this disease. Studies suggest that the lipid load and constituents, such as specific FAs, ratio of n-3 (ω-3) to n-6 (ω-6) long-chain polyunsaturated FAs, phytosterols, and vitamin E content, may be involved. There is an existing literature describing the molecular mechanisms whereby these specific nutrients affect hepatic metabolism and function via lipid and bile acid sensing nuclear receptors, such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α, liver X receptor, and farnesoid X receptor, yet virtually no information as to how they interact and modulate liver function in the context of PN in pediatric patients or animal models. This article will review the recent development of parenteral lipid emulsions and their influence on PNALD and highlight some of the emerging molecular mechanisms that may explain the effects on liver function and disease.

SERPINA1 deficiency is the most common genetic cause of hepatic disease in children and is frequently responsible for chronic liver disease in adults. Liver transplantation is currently the only available treatment for the severe form of the disease. We found that liver-directed gene transfer of transcription factor EB (TFEB), a master regulator of autophagy and lysosomal biogenesis, results in marked reduction of toxic mutant SERPINA1 polymer, apoptosis and fibrosis in the liver of a mouse model of SERPINA1 deficiency. TFEB-mediated correction of hepatic disease is dependent upon increased degradation of SERPINA1 polymer in autolysosomes and decreased expression of SERPINA1 monomer. In conclusion, TFEB gene transfer is a novel strategy for treatment of liver disease in SERPINA1 deficiency. Moreover, this study suggests that TFEB-mediated cellular clearance may have broad applications for therapy of human disorders due to intracellular accumulation of toxic proteins. ",

Anything that is both cheaper and better, but is not actually the dominant therapy, must have other drawbacks that prevent replacement of all dialysis treatment by transplantation. The barriers to universal transplantation as the therapy for end-stage kidney disease include the economic limitations which in some countries place transplantation, appropriately, at a lower priority than public health fundamentals such as clean water, sanitation, and vaccination. Even in high-income countries, the technical challenges of surgery and the consequences of immunosuppression restrict the number of suitable recipients, but the major finite restrictions on kidney transplantation rates are the shortage of donated organs and the limited medical, surgical, and nursing workforces with the required expertise.

A variety of statistical techniques were employed, and, overall, the findings can be summarized into 2 points. First, the results show that the relationships among spanking, self-regulation, and EBP are highly nuanced in that multiple explanations for their intercorrelations appear to fit the data (e.g., bidirectional relationships and shared methods variance). Second, genetic influences accounted for variance in each variable (EBP, spankings received, self-regulation) and even explained a portion of the covariance among the different variables.

A total of 35,102 men aged 45 years and older were surveyed about their alcohol drinking as part of a cohort study. These respondents were followed up over time, and all deaths were recorded. Compared with those who never drank alcohol, alcohol drinkers had 1.22 times higher risk of mortality, with the highest risk observed for liver disease (hazard ratio [HR]=3.19). Among ever drinkers, risk of mortality varied according to types (country/desi), frequency (four or less times a week, HR=1.39), and quantity of alcohol consumed (>100 mL) per day. In addition, country/desi drinkers (HR=1.34) had the highest mortality risk compared with all other types of alcohol (HR=0.97). Alcohol drinkers had increased risk of mortality for tuberculosis (HR=2.53), cerebrovascular disease (HR=1.83), and liver disease (HR=3.19). Synergistic joint effect of tobacco and alcohol on mortality was also observed, with lowest risk in never tobacco user drinkers (HR=1.02) and highest in mixed tobacco user drinkers (HR=1.79). The results of this study show a direct association between greater consumption of alcohol and increased risk of mortality from alcohol-specific causes. In addition to individual effect, this study demonstrates the synergistic interaction between alcohol and tobacco use in various forms on mortality.",

One of these drugs is diquafosol, a uridine nucleotide analog that is an agonist of the P2Y2 receptor. Several randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that the application of topical diquafosol significantly improves objective markers of DED such as corneal and conjunctival fluorescein staining and, in some studies, tear film break-up time and Schirmer test scores. However, this has been accompanied by only partial improvement in patient symptoms. Although evidence from the literature is still relatively limited, early studies have suggested that diquafosol has a role in the management of DED. Additional studies would be helpful to delineate how different subgroups of DED respond to diquafosol. The therapeutic combination of diquafosol with other topical agents also warrants further investigation. ",

Diseases, such as diabetes, or drug exposure that causes disruption of the podocyte foot process morphology results in kidney pathophysiology. Proteomic analysis of glomeruli isolated from rats with puromycin-induced kidney disease and control rats indicated that protein kinase A (PKA), which is activated by adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP), is a key regulator of podocyte morphology and function. In podocytes, cAMP signaling activates cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) to enhance expression of the gene encoding a differentiation marker, synaptopodin, a protein that associates with actin and promotes its bundling. We constructed and experimentally verified a β-adrenergic receptor-driven network with multiple feedback and feedforward motifs that controls CREB activity. To determine how the motifs interacted to regulate gene expression, we mapped multicompartment dynamical models, including information about protein subcellular localization, onto the network topology using Petri net formalisms. These computational analyses indicated that the juxtaposition of multiple feedback and feedforward motifs enabled the prolonged CREB activation necessary for synaptopodin expression and actin bundling. Drug-induced modulation of these motifs in diseased rats led to recovery of normal morphology and physiological function in vivo. Thus, analysis of regulatory motifs using network dynamics can provide insights into pathophysiology that enable predictions for drug intervention strategies to treat kidney disease. ",

There are no studies showing efficient transduction of pig pancreas with gene-transfer vectors. Our objective is to develop a safe and efficient method to transduce wild-type (WT) porcine pancreatic ducts that express CFTR. We catheterized the umbilical artery of WT newborn pigs and delivered an adeno-associated virus serotype 9 vector expressing green-fluorescent protein (AAV9CMV.sceGFP) or vehicle to the celiac artery, the vessel that supplies major branches to the pancreas. This technique resulted in stable and dose-dependent transduction of pancreatic duct epithelial cells that expressed CFTR. Intravenous (IV) injection of AAV9CMV.sceGFP did not transduce the pancreas. Our technique offers an opportunity to deliver the CFTR gene to the pancreas of CF pigs. The celiac artery can be accessed via the umbilical artery in newborns and via the femoral artery at older ages--delivery approaches that can be translated to humans.",

In this study, we have observed that primary human hepatocytes, when infected in vitro with cell culture-grown HCV genotype 1a or 2a, display viral RNA and protein expression. Infected hepatocytes displayed a fibroblast-like shape and an extended life span. To understand the changes at the molecular level, we examined epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers. Increased mRNA and protein expression levels of vimentin, snail, slug, and twist and a loss of the epithelial cell marker E-cadherin were observed. Snail and twist, when examined separately, were upregulated in chronically HCV-infected liver biopsy specimens, indicating an onset of an active EMT state in the infected liver. An increased expression level of fibroblast-specific protein 1 (FSP-1) in the infected hepatocytes was also evident, indicating a type 2 EMT state. Infected hepatocytes had significantly increased levels of phosphorylated β-catenin (Ser(552)) as an EMT mediator, which translocated into the nucleus and activated Akt. The phosphorylation level of β-catenin at Thr(41)/Ser(45) moieties was specifically higher in control than in HCV-infected hepatocytes, implicating an inactivation of β-catenin. Together, these results suggested that primary human hepatocytes infected with cell culture-grown HCV display EMT via the activation of the Akt/β-catenin signaling pathway.

The Xpert MTB/RIF test can be a valuable new tool for early detection of TB and rifampicin resistance, with a high sensitivity and specificity. Late-generation fluoroquinolones, levofloxacin, and moxifloxacin, which are the principal drugs for the treatment of MDR-TB, show equally high efficacy and safety. Systemic steroids may reduce the overall TB mortality attributable to all forms of TB across all organ systems, although inhaled corticosteroids can increase the risk of TB development. Although fixed dose combinations were expected to reduce the risk of drug resistance and increase drug compliance, a recent meta-analysis found that they might actually increase the risk of relapse and treatment failure. Regarding treatment duration, patients with cavitation and culture positivity at 2 months of TB treatment may require more than 6 months of standard treatment. New anti-TB drugs, such as linezolid, bedaquiline, and delamanid, could improve the outcomes in drug-resistant TB. Nontuberculous mycobacterial lung disease has typical clinical and immunological phenotypes. Mycobacterial genotyping may predict disease progression, and whole genome sequencing may reveal the transmission of Mycobacterium abscessus.

The present study aims to analyze, from both a cross-sectional and longitudinal perspective, whether early psychopathic traits allow identification of a group of individuals defined by severe and persistent behavioral problems. To achieve this goal, data from a sample of 192 children (aged 6 to 11) were analyzed; from this sample, 133 children were followed-up in a new data collection that took place three years later. From the data obtained with the mCPS and CBCL (parents), and APSD and TRF (teachers), we observed that children who showed early psychopathic traits, also showed greater frequency, severity and persistence of conduct problems.

Although environmental and genetic factors were thought to be independently associated with disorders, several recent lines of evidence suggest that epigenetics bridges these two factors. Epigenetic gene regulation is essential for normal development, thus defects in epigenetics cause various rare congenital diseases. Because epigenetics is a reversible system that can be affected by various environmental factors, such as drugs, nutrition, and mental stress, the epigenetic disorders also include common diseases induced by environmental factors. In this review, we discuss the nature of epigenetic disorders, particularly psychiatric disorders, on the basis of recent findings: 1) susceptibility of the conditions to environmental factors, 2) treatment by taking advantage of their reversible nature, and 3) transgenerational inheritance of epigenetic changes, that is, acquired adaptive epigenetic changes that are passed on to offspring. These recently discovered aspects of epigenetics provide a new concept of clinical genetics.",

Event-related brain potentials (ERPs) and facial electromyograms (EMGs) were recorded during a task in which participants viewed smiling, disgusted, and neutral faces after experiencing social exclusion or inclusion. Social exclusion was manipulated using a simple ball-tossing game (Cyberball), and need threat was assessed after the game. We found that zygomaticus major muscle activity, which reflects facial mimicry, was larger in response to smiling faces after exclusion than after inclusion. In addition, P1 amplitude, which reflects visual attention, was larger for disgusted faces than for neutral faces following social exclusion. N170 amplitude, which reflects structural encoding of the face, was correlated with heightened need threat. These findings demonstrate that social exclusion induces immediate and rapid changes in attention, perception, and automatic behavior. These findings reflect the rapid and primary regulation of belonging. ",

By mating these mice with albumin-Cre mice, we generated Ggcx-deficient mice specifically in hepatocytes (Ggcx(Δliver/Δliver) mice). In contrast to conventional Ggcx knockout mice, Ggcx(Δliver/Δliver) mice had very low activity of Ggcx in the liver and survived several weeks after birth. Furthermore, compared with heterozygous mice (Ggcx(+/Δliver) ), Ggcx(Δliver/Δliver) mice had shorter life spans.

Studies from cells, experimental animal models and patients under diabetic conditions demonstrate that expression patterns of microRNAs are altered during the progression of diabetic kidney disease. Functional studies indicate that the ability of microRNAs to bind 3' untranslated region of messenger RNA not only shows their capability to regulate expression of target genes, but also their therapeutic potential to diabetic kidney disease. The presence of microRNAs in plasma, serum, and urine has been shown to be possible biomarkers in diabetic kidney disease.

Rodlet cells were present in the gills, kidney and intestine of non-CUD-affected and CUD-affected Murray cod; however, differences in the numbers were observed between the groups of fish. A significantly greater number of rodlet cells were observed in the gills and collecting ducts of CUD-affected fish.

Most of those deaths could be prevented by an early diagnosis, which would give the patients the opportunity to modify their alcohol consumption while liver lesions are still reversible. Hepatic histology is the main parameter that predicts morbidity and mortality in patients with ALD. Non-invasive methods such as biomarker tests (e.g. FibroTest(®) or FibroMetre A(®)) or hepatic elastography (FibroScan(®)) may allow diagnosing alcohol-induced liver lesion without systematic biopsy. Despite promising preliminary results, those methods are not validated yet in ALD. A validation of non-invasive methods for ALD could allow a large screening of the severe forms of this pathology.",

To evaluate the possible participation of nitric oxide (NO) in lipopolysaccharide-induced sickness behaviors, mice were submitted to the forced swim test (FST), open field test and dark-light box test. Food intake and corticosterone plasma levels were evaluated. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 100 μg/kg; i.p.) administration increased the time spent floating in the FST and decreased locomotor activity in the open field. Indeed, treatment with LPS decreased the total number of transitions between the dark and light compartments of the apparatus. In addition, LPS reduced food intake and increased corticosterone levels. Pretreatment with L-NAME (30 mg/kg; i.p.) or aminoguanidine (50mg/kg; i.p.) accentuated the behavioral changes induced by LPS in the FST, open field and light-dark box tests as well as induced an increment in hypophagia and in corticosterone levels. These findings confirm previous observations that have reported LPS-induced sickness behaviors. In addition, they provide evidence that the synthesis of NO modulates changes in depressive-like and exploratory behaviors in mice, which is supported by the fact that NO synthase inhibitors also attenuate LPS-induced behavioral changes. In addition, the present study suggests that NO may have a protective role, acting in an inhibitory feedback manner to limit LPS-induced sickness behavior.",

The present study evaluated the susceptibility of pigs to L. intracellularis after 10, 20 and 40 passages in vitro. Three groups (six animals/group) were inoculated with pure culture of L. intracellularis on passage 10, 20 or 40 and one group with placebo. The animals were monitored for clinical signs, fecal shedding and serological IgG response during 28 days post-inoculation. Gross and histologic lesions and the level of infection based on the amount of L. intracellularis-specific antigen in the intestinal mucosa identified by immunohistochemistry were evaluated in two animals from each group on days 14, 21 and 28. Animals inoculated with passages 10 and 20 demonstrated proliferative lesions typical of porcine proliferative enteropathy associated with the presence of Lawsonia-specific antigen in the intestinal mucosa. Passage 40-inoculated pigs did not show proliferative lesions or presence of Lawsonia antigen at any time point throughout the study. Similar patterns of the fecal shedding were observed in passage 10 and 20-infected pigs but those infected with passage 40 shed for a short period. Serological IgG responses in passage 10 and 20-inoculated pigs were detected from day 14 post-infection but not at all in passage 40-inoculated animals. These results demonstrate attenuation of the virulence properties of L. intracellularis between 20 and 40 cell passages in vitro. This information will be valuable for design of future experimental models and for studying the mechanisms involved in the attenuation of L. intracellularis virulence.",

However, the molecular mechanism of how oxidative stress affects the secretory function of exocrine glands is unclear. We developed a novel mev-1 conditional transgenic mouse model (Tet-mev-1) using a modified tetracycline system (Tet-On/Off system). This mouse model demonstrated decreased tear production with morphological changes including leukocytic infiltration and fibrosis. We found that the mev-1 gene encodes Cyt-1, which is the cytochrome b(560) large subunit of succinate-ubiquinone oxidoreductase in complex II of mitochondria (homologous to succinate dehydrogenase C subunit (SDHC) in humans). The mev-1 gene induced excessive oxidative stress associated with ocular surface epithelial damage and a decrease in protein and aqueous secretory function. This new model provides evidence that mitochondrial oxidative damage in the lacrimal gland induces lacrimal dysfunction resulting in dry eye disease. Tear volume in Tet-mev-1 mice was lower than in wild type mice and histopathological analyses showed the hallmarks of lacrimal gland inflammation by intense mononuclear leukocytic infiltration and fibrosis in the lacrimal gland of Tet-mev-1 mice.

We investigated the therapeutic potential of liver-directed gene transfer of transcription factor EB (TFEB), a master gene that regulates lysosomal function and autophagy, in PiZ transgenic mice, recapitulating the human hepatic disease. Hepatocyte TFEB gene transfer resulted in dramatic reduction of hepatic ATZ, liver apoptosis and fibrosis, which are key features of alpha-1-anti-trypsin deficiency. Correction of the liver phenotype resulted from increased ATZ polymer degradation mediated by enhancement of autophagy flux and reduced ATZ monomer by decreased hepatic NFκB activation and IL-6 that drives ATZ gene expression. In conclusion, TFEB gene transfer is a novel strategy for treatment of liver disease of alpha-1-anti-trypsin deficiency. This study may pave the way towards applications of TFEB gene transfer for treatment of a wide spectrum of human disorders due to intracellular accumulation of toxic proteins.",

In an attempt to unveil the neuronal basis of the role of the OMV in SPA, we recorded Purkinje cell simple spikes (PC SS) of trained monkeys. Individual PC SS exhibited specific changes of their discharge patterns during the course of SPA. However, these individual changes did not provide a reliable explanation of the behavioral changes. On the other hand, the population response of PC SS perfectly reflected the changes resulting from adaptation. Population vector was calculated using all cells recorded independent of their location. A population code conveying the behavioral changes is in full accordance with the anatomical convergence of PC axons on target neurons in the cerebellar nuclei. Its computational advantage is the ease with which it can be adjusted to the needs of the behavior by changing the contribution of individual PC SS based on error feedback.",

        "medline_abstract_text":"Activation of the immune system elicits several behavioral changes collectively called sickness. Among the behavioral changes, systemic infections induce an increase in time spent in nonrapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep and an increase of slow wave activity (or \"sleep pressure\"). Using an inducible, astrocyte-specific transgenic dominant negative SNARE (dnSNARE) mouse line we recently demonstrated that gliotransmission plays an important role in sleep homeostasis through an adenosine receptor 1 (A1R)-sensitive pathway. It has been hypothesized that systemic infection, mimicked by peripheral administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), increases sleeping behavior in part through upregulation of central adenosine levels. Moreover, as a source of immunologically relevant factors, astrocytes play a pivotal role in the central nervous system immune and inflammatory responses. However, little is known about the role of astrocytes in the CNS response to a peripheral immune challenge. We hypothesize that LPS impacts sleep homeostasis through the modulation of astrocyte-derived adenosine accumulation. We therefore used dnSNARE mice to determine whether astrocytes contribute to the increased sleep pressure under immune challenge and whether this is a result of changes in adenosine signaling. We demonstrate that dnSNARE-mediated gliotransmission is required for the ability of LPS to elevate sleep pressure as measured by the power of slow wave activity during NREM sleep. Moreover, in agreement with a role of astrocyte-derived adenosine in modulating sleep homeostasis, we find that intracerebroventricular infusion of the A1R antagonist 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dimethylxanthine (CPT) mimics this dnSNARE phenotype. Taken together, our data demonstrate that astrocytic adenosine acting through A1 receptors contributes to the modulation of sleep pressure by LPS.",

We treated the dominant mouse within a dyad with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (400 μg/kg, i.p.) for three consecutive days and assessed social dominance behavior. Since elder animals display increased inflammatory responses and the behaviors toward conspecifics are influenced by kinship we also assessed whether kinship and age, might influence sickness related hierarchy instability.

The aim of the present study is to investigate the hepatoprotective effect against ethanol-induced injury of bilirubin, a product of heme metabolism degradation via HO and biliverdin reductase catalysis. Ethanol-incubated primary rat hepatocytes (100 mmol/L) were treated by quercetin, bilirubin, inflammatory factors, and/or HO-1 inducer/inhibitor for 24 h, and the cellular damage was assayed. Quercetin lowered ethanol-induced glutathione depletion and superoxide dismutase inactivation, inhibited the overproduction of malondialdehyde and reactive oxygen species, and decreased the leakage of cellular aspartate aminotransferase and lactate dehydrogenase, accompanying the normalization of bilirubin level. The effect of quercetin was mimicked by exogenous bilirubin in a dose-dependent manner to some extent (within 25 μmol/L) and pharmacological HO-1 inducer hemin, but abolished by HO-1 inhibitor zinc protoporphyrin-IX. Inflammatory challenge of TNF-α plus IL-6 further aggravated ethanol-induced oxidative damage, which was also attenuated by bilirubin in part. These findings shed a light on the anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory role of bilirubin released from quercetin/HO-1 and biliverdin reductase pathway against ethanol hepatotoxicity and highlight a prospective strategy of nutritional intervention for ALD by naturally occurring quercetin to induce HO-1 with the release of bioactive end-products.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of the new criteria on the incidence of Healthcare Associated Infections (HAI) and patient survival after liver transplantation. This retrospective cohort included liver transplant recipients from 2005 to 2007. Infection notification followed the recommended criteria of the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN). Statistical analysis was performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences. Of 142 patients, 67 (47.2%) underwent transplantation before June 2006. There were no differences between the 2 periods considering patient gender, diagnosis, age, length of hospitalization, and mean time to first infection occurrence. However, the length of intensive care unit (ICU) hospitalization (P = .006) and central venous catheter (CVC) use (P = .025) were higher in the first period of the study. Comparison of time until first systemic infection before and after changes in allocation criteria showed no significant difference (log-rank = 0.06; P = .81). There was a trend toward greater lethality during the second period of the study (P = .09). There was no difference in time to death between the 2 periods (log-rank = 0.9; P = .76). However, when comparing time to death of all patients with systemic infection versus those without this event, patients without infection showed a higher mortality rate (log-rank = 15.7; P < .001).",

Important questions in this area remain to be explored, and this study considered a central question: Whether important across-individual variability in risk perceptions can be tied to important individual-level factors. This article extends the Bayesian risk updating model developed by Anwar and Loughran (2011) to determine whether the weight individuals place on new offending information differs across persons on the basis of individual characteristics. Using longitudinal data from a sample of serious youthful offenders, we found that the effect of an arrest on updated risk perceptions differs as a function of IQ and early behavioral problems. In particular, individuals low in verbal IQ and those who display early behavioral problems place greater weight on new information, suggesting that individuals who are traditionally viewed as being high in criminal propensity are more affected by arrest such that they are more likely to increase their perceived risk of getting caught when offending after experiencing an arrest. Findings support the idea that high-propensity offenders are more responsive to formal sanctions, and thus (potentially) more deterrable, than low-propensity individuals.",

These structural and functional brain changes are frequently found in multiple, discrete brain areas and may include frontal, temporal, parietal and occipital cortices as well as subcortical brain areas. However, while the structural and functional brain changes in patients are found in anatomically separated areas, these are connected through (long distance) fibers, together forming networks. Thus, instead of representing separate (patho)-physiological entities, these local changes in the brains of patients with psychiatric disorders may in fact represent different parts of the same 'elephant', i.e., the (altered) brain network. Recent developments in quantitative analysis of complex networks, based largely on graph theory, have revealed that the brain's structure and functions have features of complex networks. Here we briefly introduce several recent developments in neural network studies relevant for psychiatry, including from the 2013 special issue on Neural Networks in Psychiatry in European Neuropsychopharmacology. We conclude that new insights will be revealed from the neural network approaches to brain imaging in psychiatry that hold the potential to find causes for psychiatric disorders and (preventive) treatments in the future.",

This disease affects various animal species, including nonhuman primates, has been endemic in pigs, and is an emerging concern in horses. Non-pathogenic variants obtained through multiple passages in vitro do not induce disease, but bacterial isolates at low passage induce clinical and pathological changes. We hypothesize that genes differentially expressed between pathogenic (passage 10) and non-pathogenic (passage 60) L. intracellularis isolates encode potential bacterial virulence factors. The present study used high-throughput sequencing technology to characterize the transcriptional profiling of a pathogenic and a non-pathogenic homologous L. intracellularis variant during in vitro infection. A total of 401 genes were exclusively expressed by the pathogenic variant. Plasmid-encoded genes and those involved in membrane transporter (e.g. ATP-binding cassette), adaptation and stress response (e.g. transcriptional regulators) were the categories mostly responsible for this wider transcriptional landscape. The entire gene repertoire of plasmid A was repressed in the non-pathogenic variant suggesting its relevant role in the virulence phenotype of the pathogenic variant. Of the 319 genes which were commonly expressed in both pathogenic and non-pathogenic variants, no significant difference was observed by comparing their normalized transcription levels (fold change±2; p<0.05). Unexpectedly, these genes demonstrated a positive correlation (r(2) = 0.81; p<0.05), indicating the involvement of gene silencing (switching off) mechanisms to attenuate virulence properties of the pathogenic variant during multiple cell passages. Following the validation of these results by reverse transcriptase-quantitative PCR using ten selected genes, the present study represents the first report characterizing the transcriptional profile of L. intracellularis. The complexity of the virulence phenotype was demonstrated by the diversity of genes exclusively expressed in the pathogenic isolate. The results support our hypothesis and provide the basis for prospective mechanistic studies regarding specific roles of target genes involved in the pathogenesis, diagnosis and control of proliferative enteropathy.",

Improving long-term graft survival continues to present a major challenge in the management of kidney-transplant patients. CNIs are a key component of immunosuppressive therapy, and chronic CNI toxicity has been widely thought to be a major factor in late graft failure. However, recent studies examining the causes of late graft failure in detail have challenged this view, highlighting the importance of antibody-mediated rejection and other factors. In addition, the diagnosis of CNI nephrotoxicity represents a challenge to clinicians, with the potential for over-diagnosis and an inappropriate reduction in immunosuppressive therapy. When graft function is deteriorating, accurately determining the cause of the kidney disease is essential for effective long-term management of the patient.

Remodeling of the aging lung with thickening of the alveolar walls and reduction in the number of peripheral airways is well recognized. The present study was designed to address whether estrogen deficiency would affect age-associated changes in the lungs of female C57BL/6J mice. Lungs isolated from old mice (24 months old, estrogen-deficient) demonstrated decreased lung volume and decreased alveolar surface area. There was no difference in alveolar number in the lungs of old and young mice (6 months old, estrogen-replete). Estrogen replacement restored lung volume, alveolar surface area, and alveolar wall thickness to that of a young mouse. Estrogen receptor-α (ERα) protein expression increased without a change in ERβ protein expression in the lung tissue isolated from old mice. In the lungs of old mice, the number of apoptotic cells was increased as well as the activation of matrix metalloproteinase-2 and ERK. Young mice had the highest serum 17β-estradiol levels that decreased with age. Our data suggest that in the aging female mouse lung, estrogen deficiency and an increase of ERα expression lead to the development of an emphysematous phenotype. Estrogen replacement partially prevents these age-associated changes in the lung architecture by restoration of interalveolar septa. Understanding the role of estrogens in the remodeling of the lung during aging may facilitate interventions and therapies for aging-related lung disease in women. ",

There is a great need for implementing treatments that either prevent or significantly slow the progression of DKD. Although there have been significant improvements in management, the increasing numbers of patients with DKD illustrate that current management is not wholly adequate. The reasons for suboptimal management include the lack of early diagnosis, lack of aggressive interventions, and lack of understanding about which interventions are most successful. There are a number of challenges and controversies regarding the current management of patients with DKD. Understanding of these issues is needed in order to provide the best care to patients with DKD. This article describes some of the clinically important challenges associated with DKD: the current epidemiology and cost burden and the role of biopsy in the diagnosis of DKD.

        "medline_abstract_text":"The disparity between the demand for and supply of donor livers has continued to grow over the last 2 decades, and this has placed greater weight on the need for efficient and effective liver allocation. Although the use of extended criteria donors has shown great potential, it remains unregulated. A survival benefit-based model was recently proposed to answer calls to increase efficiency and reduce futile transplants. However, it was previously determined that the current allocation system was not in need of modification and that instead geographic disparities should be addressed. In contrast, we believe that there is a significant need to replace the current allocation system and complement efforts to improve donor liver distribution. We illustrate this need first by identifying major ethical concerns shaping liver allocation and then by using these concerns to identify strengths and shortcomings of the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease/Pediatric End-Stage Liver Disease system and a survival benefit-based model. The latter model is a promising means of improving liver allocation: it incorporates a greater number of ethical principles, uses a sophisticated statistical model to increase efficiency and reduce waste, minimizes bias, and parallels developments in the allocation of other organs. However, it remains limited in its posttransplant predictive accuracy and may raise potential issues regarding informed consent. In addition, the proposed model fails to include quality-of-life concerns and prioritize younger patients. We feel that it is time to take the next steps toward better liver allocation not only through reductions in geographic disparities but also through the adoption of a model better equipped to balance the many ethical concerns shaping organ allocation. Thus, we support the development of a similar model with suggested amendments.",

However, PTSD is characterized by large individual variations of symptoms. In order to take into consideration the complex and long term distinctive variations in effects of trauma exposure additional behavioral measures are required. The current study used a novel behavioral test, the water associated zero maze (WAZM). This test was planned to enable a formation of an association between the context of the maze and an underwater trauma (UWT) or swim stress in order to examine the impact of exposure to the context which immediately precedes a stressful or a traumatic experience on rat's complex behavior. Rats were exposed to the WAZM and immediately after to an UWT or short swim. One month later rats were re-exposed to the context of the WAZM while their behavior was video recorded. Furthermore, c-Fos expression in the amygdala was measured 90 min after this exposure. The results of the current study indicate that the WAZM can be used to discern behavioral changes measured a long time after the actual traumatic or stressful events. Furthermore, the behavioral changes detected were accompanied by changes of c-Fos expression in the amygdala of exposed rats. We suggest that the WAZM can be used to model traumatic memories re-experiencing in rodent models of human stress-related pathologies such as PTSD. ",

Ongoing clinical trials using a serotype 2 AAV vector to express RPE65 in the retinal pigment epithelium have proven safe and effective. While many proof-of-concept studies in animal models of retinal disease have suggested that gene transfer to the neural retina will also be effective, a photoreceptor-targeting AAV vector has yet to be used in the clinic, principally because a vector that efficiently but exclusively targets all primate photoreceptors has yet to be demonstrated. Here, we evaluate a serotype 5 AAV vector containing the human rhodopsin kinase (hGRK1) promoter for its ability to target transgene expression to rod and cone photoreceptors when delivered subretinally in a nonhuman primate (NHP). In vivo fluorescent fundus imaging confirmed that AAV5-hGRK1-mediated green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression was restricted to the injection blebs of treated eyes. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) revealed a lack of gross pathology after injection. Neutralizing antibodies against AAV5 were undetectable in post-injection serum samples from subjects receiving uncomplicated subretinal injections (i.e., no hemorrhage). Immunohistochemistry of retinal sections confirmed hGRK1 was active in, and specific for, both rods and cones of NHP retina. Biodistribution studies revealed minimal spread of vector genomes to peripheral tissues. These results suggest that AAV5-hGRK1 is a safe and effective AAV serotype/promoter combination for targeting therapeutic transgene expression protein to rods and cones in a clinical setting.",

Adult hippocampal neurogenesis, which is impaired in AD, is involved in learning and memory. It remains unclear, however, whether increasing adult neurogenesis improves behavioral symptoms in AD. We report that in the 3xTgAD mouse model of AD, chronic Wnt3a overexpression in the ventral hippocampus dentate gyrus (DG) restored adult neurogenesis to physiological levels. The restoration of adult neurogenesis led to full recovery of danger assessment impairment and the effect was blocked by ablation of neurogenesis with X-irradiation. Finally, using a bed nucleus of stria terminalis (BNST) mRNA expression array, we found that the expression of the 5-HT1A receptor in 3xTgAD mice is selectively decreased and normalized by Wnt3a overexpression in the ventral hippocampus DG, and this normalization is neurogenesis dependent. These findings indicate that reestablishing a functional population of hippocampal newborn neurons in adult AD mice rescues behavioral symptoms, suggesting that adult neurogenesis may be a promising therapeutic target for alleviating behavioral deficits in AD patients.

        "medline_abstract_text":"Hard metal lung disease (HMLD) is an occupational lung disease specific to inhalation of cobalt-containing particles whose mechanism is largely unknown. Cobalt is a known hypoxia mimic and stabilizer of the alpha subunits of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs). Previous work revealed that though HIF1α contrib utes to cobalt toxicity in vitro, loss of HIF1α in the alveolar epithelial cells does not provide in vivo protection from cobalt-induced lung inflammation. HIF1α and HIF2α show unique tissue expression profiles, and HIF2α is known to be the predominant HIF mRNA isoform in the adult lung. Thus, if HIF2α activation by cobalt contributes to pathophysiology of HMLD, we hypothesized that loss of HIF2α in lung epithelium would provide protection from cobalt-induced inflammation. Mice with HIF2α-deficiency in Club and alveolar type II epithelial cells (ATIIs) (HIF2α(Δ/Δ)) were exposed to cobalt (60 µg/day) or saline using a subacute occupational exposure model. Bronchoalveolar lavage cellularity, cytokines, qRT-PCR, and histopathology were analyzed. Results show that loss of HIF2α leads to enhanced eosinophilic inflammation and increased goblet cell metaplasia. Additionally, control mice demonstrated a mild recovery from cobalt-induced lung injury compared with HIF2α(Δ/Δ) mice, suggesting a role for epithelial HIF2α in repair mechanisms. The expression of important cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-5 and IL-10, displayed significant differences following cobalt exposure when HIF2α(Δ/Δ) and control mice were compared. In summary, our data suggest that although loss of HIF2α does not afford protection from cobalt-induced lung inflammation, epithelial HIF2α signaling does play an important role in modulating the inflammatory and repair response in the lung.

Laboratory findings showed that routine coagulation studies were normal, but factor XIII (FXIII) activity was low (3%). The presence of FXIII inhibitor was detected with dot blotting studies. Although the bleeding tendency was very severe, it was successfully controlled by infusion of FXIII concentrates combined with immunosuppressive treatment (oral prednisolone). Fibrin cross-linking study showed the significant delay of the γ-chain dimer and α-chain polymer formation. Western blotting revealed the marked decrease in FXIII-A level. The mixing study of FXIII activity measured using amine-incorporation assay showed the incomplete inhibition pattern. There seems to be little agreement as to the treatment strategy of acquired FXIII deficiency.

To further improve the quality and validity of its clinical practice guidelines, ERBP has revised its guideline development process. The present document outlines the principles of ERBP's 10-step approach. Important features include standard procedures for selecting topics, for assembling the guideline development group, for choosing and formulating questions, for finding, appraising and summarizing the evidence, for generating recommendations, for preparing reports and organizing peer review. ERBP has adopted the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation system for rating the quality of the evidence and strength of recommendations and has addressed implementation in the development process by integrating the GuideLine Implementability Appraisal tool. Ultimately, it is anticipated that these changes will not only further improve the quality of the guideline development process, but also enhance the quality of care and improve outcomes of patients with kidney disease across Europe.

Results demonstrate that bFGF is necessary for the proliferation of neural precursor cells and that the glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) and β-catenin pathway plays a role in it. However, the detailed mechanism of proliferation of neural precursor cells remains unclear. To elucidate that mechanism, we investigated the role of Rho-associated coiled-coil kinase (ROCK) in bFGF-induced proliferation using SH-SY5Y cells as a model of neural precursor-like cells. Y27632, a specific inhibitor of ROCK, decreased bFGF-induced proliferation. Lithium (Li), an inhibitor of GSK-3β, recovered Y27632-decreased proliferation and quercetin (Que), an inhibitor of β-catenin pathway, reversed the recovery effect of Li. Both nuclear β-catenin and cyclin D1 expression were altered by bFGF, Y27632, Li, and Que in parallel with the case of proliferation. Furthermore, bFGF inactivated GSK-3β through increasing the phosphorylation of Ser(9) on GSK-3β, which is reversed by Y27632 through increased phosphorylation of Tyr(216) on GSK-3β. ROCK has two subtypes: ROCK1 and ROCK2. Investigation with siRNA for ROCKs showed that ROCK2 is involved in bFGF-induced proliferation, but not ROCK1. These results suggest that ROCK2 might mediate bFGF-induced proliferation of SH-SY5Y cells through GSK-3β and β-catenin pathway. Further investigation of detailed mechanisms regulating the ROCK2/GSK-3β/β-catenin pathway might engender the development of new therapeutic targets of psychiatric disorders.",

Although this drug has currently demonstrated a clinical benefit for a small minority of the CF population, the developmental pathway established by ivacaftor paves the way for other CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulators that may benefit many more patients. In addition to investigating CFTR modulators, researchers are actively developing numerous other innovative CF therapies. In this review, we use the catalog of treatments currently under evaluation with the support of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, known as the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Therapeutics Pipeline, as a platform to discuss the variety of candidate treatments for CF lung disease that promise to improve CF care. Many of these approaches target the individual components of the relentless cycle of airway obstruction, inflammation, and infection characteristic of lung disease in CF, whereas others are aimed directly at the gene defect, or the resulting dysfunctional protein, that instigates this cycle. We discuss how new findings from the laboratory have informed not only the development of novel therapeutics, but also the rationales for their use and the outcomes used to measure their effects. By reviewing the breadth of candidate treatments currently in development, as well as the recent progress in CF therapies reflected by the evolution of the therapeutics pipeline over the past few years, we hope to build upon the optimism and anticipation generated by the recent success of Kalydeco.",

Here, we investigated the expression and regulation of IFRD1 in CF neutrophils. IFRD1 expression was quantified in peripheral blood and airway neutrophils from patients with CF, patients with non-CF lung disease, and healthy control subjects. The regulation of IFRD1 expression was analyzed using isolated neutrophils and ex vivo stimulation assays with CF airway fluids. IFRD1 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were analyzed in a CF cohort (n = 572) and correlated with longitudinal lung function and IFRD1 expression. Patients with CF expressed higher protein levels of IFRD1 in peripheral blood neutrophils compared with healthy or non-CF disease control subjects. Within patients with CF, IFRD1 protein expression levels in neutrophils were lower in airway fluids compared with peripheral blood. High IFRD1 expression was positively associated with the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in CF neutrophils. In vitro regulation studies showed that CF airway fluid and the CF-characteristic chemokines CXCL8 and CXCL2 down-regulated IFRD1 expression in neutrophils, an effect that was mediated through CXCR2. Genetic analyses showed that three IFRD1 SNPs were associated with longitudinal declines in lung function, and modulated IFRD1 expression. These studies demonstrate that IFRD1 expression is systemically up-regulated in human CF neutrophils, is linked to the production of ROS, and is modulated by chemokines in CF airway fluids, depending on the IFRD1 genotype.

It is unclear what causes this disparity, but transplant candidate/donor liver size mismatch may be a factor. We analyzed Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network data for patients with end-stage liver disease on the waiting list. A pooled conditional logistic regression analysis was used to assess the association between gender and LT and to determine the degree to which this association was explained by lower MELD scores or liver size. In all, 28,866 patients and 424,001 person-months were included in the analysis. The median estimated liver volume (eLV) and the median estimated liver weight (eLW) were significantly lower for women versus men on the LT waiting list (P < 0.001). When we controlled for the region and the blood type, women were 25% less likely to undergo LT in a given month in comparison with men (P < 0.001). When the MELD score was included in the model, the odds ratio (OR) for gender increased to 0.84, and this suggested that 9 percentage points of the 25% gender disparity were due to the MELD score. When eLV was added to the model, there was an additional 3% increase in the OR for gender, and this suggested that transplant candidate/donor liver size mismatch was an underlying factor for the lower LT rates in women versus men (OR = 0.87, P < 0.001). In conclusion, lower LT rates among women on the waiting list can be explained in part by lower MELD scores, eLVs, and eLWs in comparison with men. However, at least half of the gender disparity still remains unexplained.",

        "medline_abstract_text":"Neutrophil elastase (NE) is a major inflammatory mediator in cystic fibrosis (CF) that is a robust predictor of lung disease progression. NE directly causes airway injury via protease activity, and propagates persistent neutrophilic inflammation by up-regulation of neutrophil chemokine expression. Despite its key role in the pathogenesis of CF lung disease, there are currently no effective antiprotease therapies available to patients with CF. Although heparin is an effective antiprotease and anti-inflammatory agent, its anticoagulant activity prohibits its use in CF, due to risk of pulmonary hemorrhage. In this report, we demonstrate the efficacy of a 2-O, 3-O-desulfated heparin (ODSH), a modified heparin with minimal anticoagulant activity, to inhibit NE activity and to block NE-induced airway inflammation. Using an established murine model of intratracheal NE-induced airway inflammation, we tested the efficacy of intratracheal ODSH to block NE-generated neutrophil chemoattractants and NE-triggered airway neutrophilic inflammation. ODSH inhibited NE-induced keratinocyte-derived chemoattractant and high-mobility group box 1 release in bronchoalveolar lavage. ODSH also blocked NE-stimulated high-mobility group box 1 release from murine macrophages in vitro, and inhibited NE activity in functional assays consistent with prior reports of antiprotease activity. In summary, this report suggests that ODSH is a promising antiprotease and anti-inflammatory agent that may be useful as an airway therapy in CF. ",

Evolutionary theory predicts that populations with sufficient genetic variation will adapt in response to pathogen pressure. Chinook Salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha were introduced into Lake Michigan in the late 1960s from a Washington State hatchery population. In the late 1980s, collapse of the forage base and nutritional stress in Lake Michigan were thought to contribute to die-offs of Chinook Salmon due to bacterial kidney disease (BKD). Previously, we demonstrated that Lake Michigan Chinook Salmon from a Wisconsin hatchery have greater survival following BKD challenge relative to their progenitor population. Here, we evaluated whether the phenotypic divergence of these populations in BKD susceptibility was due to selection rather than genetic drift. Comparison of the overall magnitude of quantitative trait to neutral marker divergence between the populations suggested selection had occurred but a direct test of quantitative trait divergence was not significant, preventing the rejection of the null hypothesis of differentiation through genetic drift. Estimates of phenotypic variation (VP ), additive genetic variation (VA ) and narrow-sense heritability (h (2)) were consistently higher in the Wisconsin relative to the Washington population. If selection had acted on the Wisconsin population there was no evidence of a concomitant loss of genetic variation in BKD susceptibility. The Renibacterium salmoninarum exposures were conducted at both 14°C and 9°C; the warmer temperature accelerated time to death in both populations and there was no evidence of phenotypic plasticity or a genotype-by-environment (G × E) interaction. High h (2) estimates for BKD susceptibility in the Wisconsin population, combined with a lack of phenotypic plasticity, predicts that future adaptive gains in BKD resistance are still possible and that these adaptive gains would be stable under the temperature range evaluated here.",

This paper reviews the characteristics of psychiatry in former socialist countries and discusses its implications for North Korean psychiatry. Under socialism, psychiatric disorders were attributed primarily to neurophysiologic or neurobiological origins. Psychosocial or psychodynamic etiology was denied or distorted in line with the political ideology of the Communist Party. Psychiatry was primarily concerned with psychotic disorders, and this diagnostic category was sometimes applied based on political considerations. Neurotic disorders were ignored by psychiatry or were regarded as the remnants of capitalism. Several neurotic disorders characterized by high levels of somatization were considered to be neurological or physical in nature. The majority of \"mental patients\" were institutionalized for a long periods in large-scale psychiatric hospitals. Treatment of psychiatric disorders depended largely on a few outdated biological therapies. In former socialist countries, psychodynamic psychotherapy was not common, and psychiatric patients were likely to experience social stigma. According to North Korean doctors living in South Korea, North Korean psychiatry is heavily influenced by the aforementioned traditions of psychiatry. During the post-socialist transition, the suicide rate in many of these countries dramatically increased. Given such mental health crises in post-socialist transitional societies, the field of psychiatry may face major challenges in a future unified Korea. ",

High levels of oestrogenic chemical residues in water, sediment and tissue; skewed sex ratios; reduced biodiversity; gonadal malformations in sharptooth catfish and freshwater snails; intersex in catfish; and impaired spermatogenesis in catfish and striped mouse are of serious concern in the RNR. Persistent eggshell thinning in African darter eggs, intersex in male Mozambican tilapia, follicular atresia in females and impaired spermatogenesis in males following laboratory exposure of parent fish to environmentally relevant DDT and DDE concentrations, and abnormalities in freshwater snails were found in the DDT-sprayed area. Human studies related to DDT exposure indicated impaired semen quality, a weak association with sperm chromatin defects and higher risks for external urogenital birth defects in those who were born to mothers whose houses were sprayed and those who were homemakers (stay at home mother) instead of being employed. These findings indicate that diseases of sexual development occurred in both human and wildlife populations exposed to environmental endocrine disruptor chemicals in South Africa. The chemical mixtures, possibly related to disorders of sexual differentiation (DSD), were very different between the two. However, DSD occurred concurrently in the malarial area, possibly indicating that humans and wildlife shared exposures.

Foot kinematics of eight adult participants were analyzed using a repeated-measures design including two therapists with different levels of experience. The inter-trial variability was higher compared to the kinematics of healthy subjects. Consideration of relative angles resulted in the lowest inter-session variability. The absolute 3D rotations between the Sha-Cal and Cal-Met seem to have the lowest variability in both therapists. A general trend towards higher σ(sess)/σ(trial) ratios was observed when the midfoot was involved.

Treatment with peginterferon (PEG-IFN) and ribavirin (RBV) has been recommended for the treatment of HCV infection in HIV-infected patients at the greatest risk of developing liver disease. However, the effectiveness of this HCV treatment has been low because of limited efficacy in patients infected with HCV genotype 1.

Determining the relevance of this evidence to brain disorders in humans has been hampered by an inability to determine antimortem brain DHA levels and limitations associated with a postmortem approach. Accordingly, there is a need for alternate or complementary approaches to better understand the role of DHA in cortical function and pathology, and conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques may be ideally suited for this application. A major advantage of neuroimaging is that it permits prospective evaluation of the effects of manipulating DHA status on both clinical and neuroimaging variables. Emerging evidence from MRI studies suggest that greater DHA status is associated with cortical structural and functional integrity, and suggest that reduced DHA status and abnormalities in cortical function observed in psychiatric disorders may be interrelated phenomenon. Preliminary evidence from animal MRI studies support a critical role of DHA in normal brain development. Neuroimaging research in both human and animals therefore holds tremendous promise for developing a better understanding of the role of DHA status in cortical function, as well as for elucidating the impact of DHA deficiency on neuropathological processes implicated in the etiology and progression of neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders.",

Current treatments of UAKD patients are symptomatic and cannot prevent disease progression. Two in vitro studies reported a positive effect of the chemical chaperone sodium 4-phenylbutyrate (4-PBA) on mutant UMOD maturation. Thus, 4-PBA was suggested as a potential treatment for UAKD. This study evaluated the effects of 4-PBA in two mouse models of UAKD. In contrast to previous in vitro studies, treatment with 4-PBA did not increase HSP70 expression or improve maturation and trafficking of mutant UMOD in vivo. Kidney function of UAKD mice was actually deteriorated by 4-PBA treatment. In transfected tubular epithelial cells, 4-PBA did not improve maturation but increased the expression level of both mutant and wild-type UMOD protein. Activation of NF-κB pathway in thick ascending limb of Henle's loop cells of UAKD mice was detected by increased abundance of RelB and phospho-IκB kinase α/β, an indirect activator of NF-κB. Furthermore, the abundance of NF-κB1 p105/p50, NF-κB2 p100/p52, and TRAF2 was increased in UAKD. NF-κB activation was identified as a novel disease mechanism of UAKD and might be a target for therapeutic intervention. ",

Three experiments utilized variations of a delay discounting task to measure the degree of variation in impulsive choice behavior across individual rats. The individual differences accounted for 22-55% of the variance in choice behavior across the three experiments. In Experiments 2 and 3, the individual differences were still apparent when behavior was measured across multiple choice points. Large individual differences in the rate of responding, and modest individual differences in timing of responding were also observed during occasional peak trials.

The distribution of psychiatric mother-baby units around the world, as well as within countries, varies strongly. Reasons for this may be related to the absence of national perinatal mental health policies related to psychiatric mother-baby unit location, differences in sources of referral for admission, and criteria for psychiatric mother-baby unit admission.

Three groups of criteria were chosen to evaluate the decision for PH (type and severity of the psychiatric disorders, family's level of distress and parental capacity to contain the child). These criteria were rated quantitatively by using CGI-S. Highly significant inverse association was found between the level of parental capacity to contain the child and the decision to hospitalize in a psychiatric pediatric institution. The correlations between severity of the psychiatric disorders and family's level of distress was also found significant, but to a lesser extent.Parental capacity to contain the child, with its various components, is a major factor in the decision making process,when referring children to PH. This is the first study,demonstrating a strong association between parental-capacity components and the rate of hospitalization.",

Early detection and prevention may have an impact on both slowing the progression of CKD and reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. CKD prevention programmes can be more cost-efficient over time without negative impacts on quality of care. Until now, reimbursement in CKD has been segmented and usually focused on the end of the process (dialysis) when cost is higher, whereas new models focused on provider integration, while balancing quality and costs, are needed to respond to today&rsquo;s challenges. Traditionally, &ldquo;pay for services&rdquo; has been used in state-assisted dialysis centres, but this model has the risk of inducing an increase in demand. Integrated management would respond to this challenge with comprehensive solutions that manage kidney disease at all levels of health care risk. It is based on a comprehensive model that typically includes several products and services, often including pharmacological treatments. The rate of reimbursement directly depends on the achievement of previously defined quality control parameters. The third model is based on a &ldquo;capitation&rdquo; model that consists of the provider receiving a set amount of resources per population for a particular time regardless of the volume of services provided. The complexity and the progressive nature of CKD along with the associated morbidity rates in these patients force us to consider a global approach rather than a sum of different services. In our opinion, the first method of reimbursement in CKD that should be considered is a bundle rate, and when this model has been consolidated, tending toward a global capitation model.",

Many of these newly catalogued functional elements represent epigenetic mechanisms involved in regulation of gene expression. Analogous to an Ishihara plate, a gene-coding region of DNA (target dots) only comes into context when the non-coding DNA (surrounding dots) is appreciated. In this review we provide an overview of the ENCODE project, discussing the significance of these data for ophthalmic research and eye disease.

Financial barriers cited included fear of becoming unable to work, losing one's job, or being unable to pay household bills while recovering. Participants also identified logistic barriers for undocumented immigrants (eg, the inability to obtain government insurance for transplant candidates and uncertainty about their eligibility to donate).

Hamsters are a well-published animal model for PPE infection studies in pigs. There is no laboratory animal model for EPE infection studies and it is not known whether there is species-specificity for equine or porcine isolates of L. intracellularis in animal models. The objective of this study was to determine whether it is possible to generate typical EPE lesions in hamsters after inoculation with an equine strain of L. intracellularis (EPE strain) and whether it is comparatively possible to generate PPE lesions in rabbits after inoculation with a porcine strain of L. intracellularis (PPE strain). In 2 separate trials, 4-week-old and 3-week-old weanling golden Syrian hamsters were challenged with EPE strains and compared to uninfected (both trials) and PPE-infected controls (Trial 2 only). Concurrently, 6 female New Zealand white juvenile rabbits were infected with PPE strain and observed concomitantly to 8 similar rabbits infected with EPE strain for a different experiment. Hamsters and rabbits were observed for 21 to 24 days post-infection (DPI), depending on the experiment. Neither infected species developed clinical signs. The presence of disease was assessed with diagnostic techniques classically used for pigs and horses: immune-peroxidase monolayer assay on sera; quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) detection of molecular DNA in feces; and hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stain and immunohistochemistry (IHC) on intestinal tissues. Our results showed that EPE-challenged hamsters do not develop infection when compared with PPE controls (IHC, P = 0.009; qPCR, P = 0.0003). Conversely, PPE-challenged rabbits do not develop typical intestinal lesions in comparison to EPE-challenged rabbits, with serological response at 14 DPI being significantly lower (P = 0.0023). In conclusion, PPE and EPE strains appear to have different host-specificities for hamsters and rabbits, respectively. ",

Psychiatric disorders and socio-demographic factors including work-related factors were assessed by a semi-structured interview using the psychological autopsy method in 163 completed suicide cases and by personal interview in 396 living population-based control persons. Unemployment (in particular, for more than six months), (early) retirement, or homemaker status were associated with highly significantly increased suicide risk, independently of categorized psychiatric diagnosis. In addition, adverse psychosocial working conditions, such as monotonous work, increased responsibility and pronounced mental strain due to contact with work clients, significantly increased suicide risk as well, again independently of categorized psychiatric diagnosis. These findings demonstrate that negative consequences of unemployment, homemaker status with no outside occupation, or (early) retirement, as well as adverse psychosocial working conditions, present relevant risk factors contributing to suicidal behavior, independently of diagnosed psychiatric disorders. Employment and a positive modification of working conditions, may possibly be preventive to important adverse mental health outcomes, including suicidality.",

We examined the presence of IL-18 protein in normal and impaired spermatogenesis. Testicular tissue specimens were taken from 25 nonobstructive azoospermic patients undergoing testicular sperm extraction and from autopsies of three healthy controls. The presence of IL-18 in human testicular cells was examined by immunohistochemical staining of paraffin-embedded sections, using a specific antibody for human IL-18. In testicular tissue of healthy controls as well as in study cases, presence of IL-18 was identified in somatic, mitotic, meiotic and post-meiotic cells in correlation with their presence. In all patients, Leydig cells were less intensively stained. Mitotic cells were immunostained in the control group and less intensively in hypospermatogenesis and maturation arrest subgroups. Primary spermatocytes were in general most efficiently stained. The expression of IL-18 mRNA (as examined by real-time PCR analysis) showed significantly lower expression in testicular tissues with impaired spermatogenesis when compared to normal tissues. We report the first study demonstrating the presence of IL-18 in human testicular tissue at the protein level. The presence of this cytokine in somatic as well as in different types of germ cells may suggest its involvement in the regulation of the spermatogenic process and steroidogenesis under physiological and pathological conditions.",

Many of the \"rules\" concerning the interpretation of the spirogram have been based entirely on adult observations. In the age of increasing conformity, and attempts  to relate \"adult\" literature to the pediatric population, the latter was given much less emphasis than the former. This review will attempt to show what areas in pulmonary function testing are similar in adults and children, but more specifically will show the areas that are different.  The latest standards published by the American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society in 2005 have attempted to incorporate some differences for the pediatric population for spirometry, but more work needs to be done in this area. While it is recognized that spirometry is the primary  pulmonary function test for children, there are a number of circumstances where the addition of plethysmography and lung diffusion measurements are necessary. The review will state some of the limitations of these tests when performed by children. Lung function testing, particularly spirometry,  has much to offer in the diagnosis of lung disease in children and the monitoring of response to therapy. With better standardization of pulmonary function testing in children, and more trained technologists, the age limits for testing can be extended to below 6 years of age and sometimes  below 5. Also with better standardization the results obtained are meaningful and when interpreted in context of age offer excellent diagnostic information to better treat the child with lung disease.",

In CF patients with an abnormal lung clearance index (LCI), Scond* (but not Scond) and Sacin* were significant contributors to LCI (β(Scond*)=0.70; β(Sacin*)=0.49; P<0.001 for both).

The majority of the intervening research has focused on a class of naturally occurring steroids that are metabolites of progesterone and deoxycorticosterone, which act in a non-genomic manner to selectively augment signals mediated by the main inhibitory receptor in the CNS, the GABA(A) receptor. Abnormal levels of such neurosteroids associate with a variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders, suggesting that they serve important physiological and pathophysiological roles. A compelling case can be made to implicate neurosteroids in stress-related disturbances. Here we will critically appraise how brain-derived neurosteroids may impact on the stress response to acute and chronic challenges, both pre- and postnatally through to adulthood. The pathological implications of such actions in the development of psychiatric disturbances will be discussed, with an emphasis on the therapeutic potential of neurosteroids for the treatment of stress-associated disorders.",

It binds gram-negative bacteria and is overexpressed in human cancers. CEACAM6 is associated with lamellar bodies of cultured type II cells of human fetal lung and protects surfactant function in vitro. In this study, we characterized CEACAM6 expression in vivo in human lung. CEACAM6 was present in lung lavage of premature infants at birth and increased progressively in intubated infants with lung disease. Of surfactant-associated CEACAM6, ∼80% was the fully glycosylated, 90-kDa form that contains the glycophosphatidylinositol anchor, and the concentration (3.9% of phospholipid for adult lung) was comparable to that for surfactant proteins (SP)-A/B/C. We examined the affinity of CEACAM6 by purification of surfactant on density gradient centrifugation; concentrations of CEACAM6 and SP-B per phospholipid were unchanged, whereas levels of total protein and SP-A decreased by 60%. CEACAM6 mRNA content decreased progressively from upper trachea to peripheral fetal lung, whereas protein levels were similar in all regions of adult lung, suggesting proximal-to-distal developmental expression in lung epithelium. In adult lung, most type I cells and ∼50% of type II cells were immunopositive. We conclude that CEACAM6 is expressed by alveolar and airway epithelial cells of human lung and is secreted into lung-lining fluid, where fully glycosylated protein binds to surfactant. Production appears to be upregulated during neonatal lung disease, perhaps related to roles of CEACAM6 in surfactant function, cell proliferation, and innate immune defense.",

Molecular influences can be identified using many data types including genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, and proteomics. The emerging field of network medicine offers a new approach to explore the complexities of disease development in a framework that considers a holistic, rather than a reductionist viewpoint.

The purpose of this review is to provide a succinct overview of the neurocircuitry involved in drug addiction, as well as the acute and chronic effects of cocaine and amphetamines within this circuitry in humans. Investigational pharmacological treatments for illicit psychostimulant addiction are also reviewed. Our current knowledge base clearly demonstrates that illicit psychostimulants produce lasting adaptive neural and behavioral changes that contribute to the progression and maintenance of addiction. However, attempts at generating pharmacological treatments for psychostimulant addiction have historically focused on intervening at the level of the acute effects of these drugs. The lack of approved pharmacological treatments for psychostimulant addiction highlights the need for new treatment strategies, especially those that prevent or ameliorate the adaptive neural, cognitive, and behavioral changes caused by chronic use of this class of illicit drugs.

The 5-HT7 receptor is the most recently identified member of the 5-HT receptor subtypes, and the physiological role of this receptor is still unknown. Recently, either selective agonists or antagonists for 5-HT7 receptors, as well as 5-HT7 receptor knockout mice, have been developed, and these have recently been used as the experimental tools for determining the actual function of 5-HT7 receptors. The first half of the present article introduces the reports that have examined the role of the 5-HT7 receptor on emotional regulation. On the other hand, it has been indicated that the ability to adapt to stress is an important defensive function of a living body, and impairment of this ability may contribute to some stress-related disorders. Thus, the examination of brain mechanisms involved in stress adaptation could help to pave the way for new therapeutic strategies for stress-related psychiatric disorders.

The mRNA levels of the IGF components studied were analyzed by real time PCR and in situ hybridization, and IGFBP expression and activity were assayed by immunohistochemistry and ligand blot, respectively. Results showed a decreased IGF1 mRNA level due to a lower granulosa cell gene expression in cystic follicles (P<0.05).

However, the number of U.S. medical graduates choosing nephrology careers has declined precipitously. Although workforce diversity has improved, the gains are modest. Leadership in kidney disease research and innovation is threatened by significant disincentives to the pursuit of research track careers. Meanwhile, various factors challenge reliable predictions of physician workforce demand: marked growth of the CKD and ESRD populations, shifting health care economics and access, restricted opportunities for international medical graduates, expansion of advanced practitioner utilization, and aging of the contemporary practicing physician cohort. Changing demographics and cultural shifts, including perceptions of work-life balance and quality of life, increasingly influence medical student and resident career choices. Negative student and resident attitudes toward core nephrology educational experiences and perceptions of nephrology careers are disquieting. The American Society of Nephrology has initiated a series of programs aimed at renewing interest among students and residents in nephrology careers and research training and continuing to improve the diversity of the nephrology workforce, both critical to ensuring there will be enough nephrologists to care for a growing kidney disease population.

Multiple observations link serum uric acid levels to kidney disease development and progression in diabetes and strongly argue that uric acid lowering should be tested as one such novel intervention. A pilot of such a trial, using allopurinol, is currently being conducted by the Preventing Early Renal Function Loss (PERL) Consortium. Although the PERL trial targets T1D individuals at highest risk of kidney function decline, the use of allopurinol as a renoprotective agent may also be relevant to a larger segment of the population with diabetes. As allopurinol is inexpensive and safe, it could be cost-effective even for relatively low-risk patients, pending the completion of appropriate trials at earlier stages. ",

When considering the impact of liver transplantation for metabolic disease two independent factors need to be considered; whether or not the defect causes liver disease and whether or not it is confined to the liver. When considering transplantation many factors need to be considered including the local success of transplantation, the impact of the metabolic disease on the patient and family and the potential for future therapeutic developments. Where transplantation is undertaken for a liver based defect there is a lifelong complete correction of the defect. Where there is a residual extrahepatic defect this will have an impact on the outcome of liver transplantation and the severity of this defect must be considered as part of the transplant assessment process. Access to a multi-disciplinary team with expertise in metabolic disease, liver disease and other relevant organ based specialists is crucial. Most children will receive transplantation from cadaveric donor but living related transplantation from a heterozygote parent is usually safe and effective. Auxiliary liver transplantation has a small but useful role where partial correction of the defect is helpful and there is a future prospect of gene therapy. The first-generation of hepatocyte transplants have shown proof of principle but to date have had a rather modest and temporary metabolic effect. Stem cells may have the potential to produce a more sustained and significant metabolic correction, but must be shown to be effective in controlled trials. ",

Seeds of C. juncea containing 0.074% of dehydropyrrolizidine alkaloids (DHPAs) (isohemijunceines 0.05%, trichodesmine 0.016%, and junceine 0.008%) were administered to three donkeys at 0.3, 0.6 and 1 g/kg body weight (g/kg) daily for 365 days. No clinical signs were observed and, on liver and lung biopsies, the only lesion was a mild liver megalocytosis in the donkeys ingesting 0.6 and 1 g/kg/day. Two other donkeys that received daily doses of 3 and 5 g seed/kg showed initial respiratory signs 70 and 40 days after the start of the administration, respectively. The donkeys were euthanized following severe respiratory signs and the main lung lesions were proliferation of Clara cells and interstitial fibrosis. Three donkeys ingested seeds of C. retusa containing 5.99% of monocrotaline at daily doses of 0.025, 0.05 and 0.1 g/kg for 365 days. No clinical signs were observed and, on liver and lung biopsies, the only lesion was moderate liver megalocytosis in each of the three donkeys. One donkey that received a single dose of 5 g/kg of C. retusa seeds and another that received 1 g/kg daily for 7 days both showed severe clinical signs and died with diffuse centrilobular liver necrosis. No lung lesions were observed. Another donkey that received a single dose of 2.5 g/kg of C. retusa seeds showed no clinical signs. The hepatic and pneumotoxic effects observed are consistent with an etiology involving DHPAs. Furthermore, the occurrence of lung or liver lesions correlates with the type of DHPAs contained in the seeds. Similarly as has been reported for horses, the data herein suggest that in donkeys some DHPAs are metabolized in the liver causing liver disease, whereas others are metabolized in the lung by Clara cells causing lung disease.

The study included 32 eyes of Caucasian RGP and SCL wearers between the age of 21 and 42 who wore contact lenses continuously on a daily basis for more than 2 years. Symptoms were assessed according to the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI). Clinical assessments included corneal fluorescein staining according to the National Eye Institute (NEI) staining grid, tear film break-up time (TBUT) and Schirmer II test. There were more male (62.5%) than female (37.5%) patients with a higher proportion of RGP wearers among males (40% vs. 17%) in the study. The mean duration of daily lens wear was 10.6 +/- 5.37 hours, with a significantly higher proportion of patients who wore their lenses for prolonged hours in the soft contact lens group (p < 0.05). There was a trend towards a higher proportion of self reported mild and moderate dry eye in females and soft contact lens wearers. No RGP wearer in this study had a NEI corneal staining grid score higher than 2. A moderate negative correlation was found between daily lens wear duration and TBUT (Pearson's coefficient, r = -0.47) as well as Schirmer II values and higher OSDI score, i.e. mild and moderate dry eye categories (r = -0.50). A strong positive correlation was found between and TBUT and Schirmer II values (r = 0.74). The results of the study emphasize the importance of early and accurate diagnosis of dry eye disease for successful long term RGP and SCL contact lens wear which will hopefully motivate future larger scale investigations on dry eye related problems in contact lens wearers.",

However, despite widespread use of terms such as adherence and compliance, there is little agreement on definitions or measurements. Nonadherence can be intermittent or continuous, voluntary or involuntary, and may be specific to single or multiple interventions, which makes reliable measurement problematic. Both direct and indirect methods of assessment have their limitations. The current literature focuses mainly on psychotic disorders. A large number of trials of various psychological, social, and pharmacologic interventions has been reported. The results are mixed, but interventions specifically designed to improve adherence with a more intensive and focused approach and interventions combining elements from different approaches such as cognitive-behavioral therapy, family-based, and community-based approaches have shown better outcomes. Pharmacologic interventions include careful drug selection, switching when a treatment is not working, dose adjustment, simplifying the treatment regimen, and the use of long-acting injections. The results for the most studied pharmacologic intervention, ie, long-acting injections, are far from clear, and there are discrepancies between randomized controlled trials, nationwide cohort studies, and mirror-image studies. Nonadherence with treatment is often paid far less attention in routine clinical practice and psychiatric training. Strategies to measure and improve adherence in clinical practice are based more on personal experience than on research evidence. This overview focuses on strategies used for improving treatment adherence in psychiatric disorders in the light of current evidence, with emphasis on public health aspects of treatment adherence and the management of nonadherence in routine clinical practice.

Heritability was estimated based on a classical twin paradigm using structured equation modeling. Significant genetic influences were estimated in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and left frontal pole. The degrees of heritability were 66% and 75% in the variances, respectively.

        "medline_abstract_text":"Both oxytocin (OT) and vasopressin (AVP) are known to modulate social behavior, and dysfunction in both systems has been postulated as a potential cause of certain psychiatric disorders that involve social behavioral deficits. In particular, there is growing interest in intranasal OT as a potential treatment for certain psychiatric disorders, and preliminary pre-clinical and clinical studies suggest efficacy in alleviating some of the associated symptoms. However, the vast majority of research participants in these studies have been male, and there is evidence for sexually differentiated effects of nonapeptides in both humans and non-human animals. To date, no study has investigated the effect of intranasal OT on brain function in human males and females within the same paradigm. Previously, in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind fMRI study, we reported effects of intranasal OT and AVP on behavior and brain activity of human males as they played an interactive social game known as the Prisoner's Dilemma Game. Here, we present findings from an identical study in human females, and compare these with our findings from males. Overall, we find that both behavioral and neural responses to intranasal OT and AVP are highly sexually differentiated. In women, AVP increased conciliatory behavior, and both OT and AVP caused women to treat computer partners more like humans. In men, AVP increased reciprocation of cooperation from both human and computer partners. However, no specific drug effects on behavior were shared between men and women. During cooperative interactions, both OT and AVP increased brain activity in men within areas rich in OT and AVP receptors and in areas playing a key role in reward, social bonding, arousal and memory (e.g., the striatum, basal forebrain, insula, amygdala and hippocampus), whereas OT and AVP either had no effect or in some cases actually decreased brain activity in these regions in women. OT treatment rendered neural responses of males more similar to responses of females in the placebo group and vice versa, raising the prospect of an inverted u-shaped dose response to central OT levels. These findings emphasize the need to fully characterize the effects of intranasal OT and AVP in both males and females and at multiple doses before widespread clinical application will be warranted.

        "medline_abstract_text":"Sustained attention, often referred to as vigilance in humans, is the ability to maintain goal-directed behavior for extended periods of time and respond to intermittent targets in the environment. With greater time-on-task the ability to detect targets decreases and reaction time increases-a phenomenon termed the vigilance decrement. The purpose of this study was to examine the role of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in the vigilance decrement. Subjects (n=19) received prefrontal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) at one of two different time points during a vigilance task (early or late). The impact of tDCS was examined using measures of behavior, hemispheric blood flow velocity, and regional blood oxygenation relative to sham stimulation. In the sham condition greater time-on-task was accompanied by fewer target detections and slower reaction times, indicating a vigilance decrement, and decreased blood flow velocity. tDCS significantly altered baseline task-induced physiologic and behavioral changes, dependent on the time of stimulation administration and electrode configuration (determining polarity of stimulation). Compared to the sham condition, with more time-on-task blood flow velocity decreased less and cerebral oxygenation increased more in the tDCS condition. Behavioral measures showed a significant improvement in target detection performance with tDCS compared to the sham stimulation. Signal detection analysis revealed a significant change in operator discriminability and response bias with increased time-on-task, as well as interactions between time of stimulation administration and electrode configuration. Current density modeling of tDCS showed high densities in the medial prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex. These findings confirm that cerebral hemodynamic measures provide an index of resource utilization and point to the central role of the frontal cortex in vigilance. Further, they suggest that modulation of the frontal cortices-and connected structures-influences the availability of vigilance resources. These findings indicate that tDCS may be well-suited to mitigate performance degradation in work settings requiring sustained attention or as a possible treatment for neurological or psychiatric disorders involving sustained attention.

However, whether these immune responses are a consequence or cause of ocular surface inflammation remains to be determined. Thus far, only models of acute DED have been used to derive experimental data. This is in contrast to clinical DED which usually presents as a chronic disease. In the present study, using a murine model of chronic DED, it was established that the chronic phase of the disease is accompanied by T helper type 17 (Th17) responses at the ocular surface and that a significant memory T-cell population can be recovered from chronic DED. This memory response is predominantly mediated by Th17 cells. Moreover, adoptive transfer of this memory T-cell population was shown to induce more severe and rapidly progressing DED than did the adoptive transfer of its effector or naive counterparts. Not only do these results clearly demonstrate that effector memory Th17 cells are primarily responsible for maintaining the chronic and relapsing course of DED, but they also highlight a potentially novel therapeutic strategy for targeting memory immune responses in patients with DED.

Despite the tremendous health implications, how particle size and surface chemistry affect mobility in respiratory mucus from humans without lung disease is not known. We prepared polymeric nanoparticles densely coated with low molecular weight polyethylene glycol (PEG) to minimize muco-adhesion, and compared their transport to that of uncoated particles in human respiratory mucus, which we collected from the endotracheal tubes of surgical patients with no respiratory comorbidities. We found that 100 and 200 nm diameter PEG-coated particles rapidly penetrated respiratory mucus, at rates exceeding their uncoated counterparts by approximately 15- and 35-fold, respectively. In contrast, PEG-coated particles ≥500 nm in diameter were sterically immobilized by the mucus mesh. Thus, even though respiratory mucus is a viscoelastic solid at the macroscopic level (as measured using a bulk rheometer), nanoparticles that are sufficiently small and muco-inert can penetrate the mucus as if it were primarily a viscous liquid. These findings help elucidate the barrier properties of respiratory mucus and provide design criteria for therapeutic nanoparticles capable of penetrating mucus to approach the underlying airway epithelium.",

However the production of HCN by salivary peroxidase in the oral cavity increases orally exhaled concentrations, and may not reflect the condition of the lower airways. Using SIFT-MS we aimed to determine an appropriate single-exhalation breathing maneuver which avoids the interference of HCN produced in the oral cavity. We have established that the SIFT-MS Voice200™ is suitable for the online measurement of HCN in exhaled breath. In healthy volunteers a significantly higher end exhaled HCN concentration was measured in oral exhalations compared to nasal exhalations (mean ± SD) 4.5 ± 0.6 ppb versus 2.4 ± 0.3 ppb, p < 0.01. For the accurate and reproducible quantification of end exhaled HCN in breath a nasal inhalation to full vital capacity and nasal exhalation at controlled flow is recommended. This technique was subsequently used to measure exhaled HCN in a group of patients with chronic suppurative lung disease (CSLD) and known microbiological colonization status to determine utility of HCN measurement to detect P. aeruginosa. Median nasal end exhaled HCN concentrations were higher in patients with CSLD (3.7 ppb) than normal subjects (2.0 ppb). However no differences between exhaled HCN concentrations of subjects colonized with P. aeruginosa and other organisms were identified, indicating that breath HCN is not a suitable biomarker of P. aeruginosa colonization.",

In Drosophila, postmating behavioral changes are triggered by sex peptide (SP), a male seminal fluid peptide that acts via a receptor (SPR) expressed in sensory neurons (SPSNs) of the female reproductive tract. Here, we identify second-order neurons that mediate the behavioral changes induced by SP. These SAG neurons receive synaptic input from SPSNs in the abdominal ganglion and project to the dorsal protocerebrum. Silencing SAG neurons renders virgin females unreceptive, whereas activating them increases the receptivity of females that have already mated. Physiological experiments demonstrate that SP downregulates the excitability of the SPSNs, and hence their input onto SAG neurons. These data thus provide a physiological correlate of mating status in the female central nervous system and a key entry point into the brain circuits that control sexual receptivity. ",

A recent model of mucus clearance predicts that mucus flow depends on the relative mucin concentration of the mucus layer compared with that of the periciliary layer; however, mucin concentrations have been difficult to measure in CF secretions. Here, we have shown that the concentration of mucin in CF sputum is low when measured by immunologically based techniques, and mass spectrometric analyses of CF mucins revealed mucin cleavage at antibody recognition sites. Using physical size exclusion chromatography/differential refractometry (SEC/dRI) techniques, we determined that mucin concentrations in CF secretions were higher than those in normal secretions. Measurements of partial osmotic pressures revealed that the partial osmotic pressure of CF sputum and the retained mucus in excised CF lungs were substantially greater than the partial osmotic pressure of normal secretions. Our data reveal that mucin concentration cannot be accurately measured immunologically in proteolytically active CF secretions; mucins are hyperconcentrated in CF secretions; and CF secretion osmotic pressures predict mucus layer-dependent osmotic compression of the periciliary liquid layer in CF lungs. Consequently, mucin hypersecretion likely produces mucus stasis, which contributes to key infectious and inflammatory components of CF lung disease. ",

        "medline_abstract_text":"About half or more of the patients with chronic psychiatric illnesses, either do not take their medications correctly, or completely stop taking them. The problem of poor initial compliance or adherence is often compounded by a continued decline in compliance/adherence over time. The failure to take medicines, adversely affects the outcome of treatment, and places a huge burden of wasted resources on the society. Three terms have been used to describe medication-taking among patients with chronic psychiatric disorders. Compliance is defined as \"the extent to which the patient's behaviour matches the prescriber's recommendations\". Though compliance has been frequently employed to describe medication-taking behaviour, it has proved problematic because it refers to a process where the clinician decides on a suitable treatment, which the patient is expected to comply with unquestioningly. Studies over the past few decades have emphasized the importance of patients' perspectives in medication-taking, based on their own beliefs, their personal circumstances, the information and resources available for them. Adherence has been used as a replacement for compliance in an effort to place the clinician-patient relationship in its proper perspective. Adherence refers to a process, in which the appropriate treatment is decided after a proper discussion with the patient. It also implies that the patient is under no compulsion to accept a particular treatment, and is not to be held solely responsible for the occurrence of non-adherence. Adherence has been defined as \"the extent to which a person's behaviour, taking medication, following a diet, and/or executing lifestyle changes, corresponds with agreed recommendations from a health care provider\". To overcome certain problems in the concept of adherence, a third term concordance has been used. The concept of concordance has evolved from a narrower view, emphasizing an agreement between the clinician and the patient, which takes into account each other's perspective on medication-taking, to a broader process consisting of open discussions with the patient regarding medication-taking, imparting information and supporting patients on long-term medication. It is a process, which entertains patients' views on medication-taking, and acknowledges that patients' views have to be respected even if they make choices, which appear to be in conflict with the clinician's views. Although none of these terms are ideal solutions to understanding the complex process of medication-taking behaviour of patients, the move from compliance to adherence and concordance represents genuine progress in this field, which puts the patient's perceptions at the centre of the whole process.

Comparison of hydrochemical data of both the areas indicates that groundwater in Srikakulam coastal region is less mineralized than that of the Prakasham region, which may be due to geological, hydrological and climatic reasons.

Distribution of different glycoisoforms of certain proteins may reflect disease conditions and, therefore, can potentially be utilized as biomarkers. Apolipoprotein C3 (ApoC3) is one of the many plasma glycoproteins extensively studied for association with disease states. ApoC3 exists in three main glycoisoforms, including ApoC3-1 and ApoC3-2, which contain an O-linked carbohydrate moiety consisting of three and four monosaccharide residues, respectively, and ApoC3-0 that lacks the entire glycosylation chain. Changes in the ratio of different glycoisoforms of ApoC3 have been observed in pathological conditions such as kidney disease, liver disease, and diabetes. They may provide important information for diagnosis, prognosis, and evaluation of therapeutic response for metabolic conditions. In this current work, a liquid chromatography (LC)-high-resolution (HR) time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) method was developed for relative quantitation of different glycoisoforms of intact ApoC3 in human plasma. The samples were processed using a solid-phase extraction (SPE) method and then subjected to LC-full scan HRMS analysis. Isotope peaks for each targeted glycoisoform at two charge states were extracted using a window of 50 mDa and integrated into a chromatographic peak. The peak area ratios of ApoC3-1/ApoC3-0 and ApoC3-2/ApoC3-0 were calculated and evaluated for assay performance. The results indicated that the ratio can be determined with excellent reproducibility in multiple subjects. It has also been observed that the ratios remained constant in plasma exposed to room temperature, freeze-thaw cycles, and long-term frozen storage. The method was applied in preliminary biomarker research of diabetes by analyzing plasma samples collected from normal, prediabetic, and diabetic subjects. Significant differences were revealed in the ApoC3-1/ApoC3-0 ratio and in the ApoC3-2/ApoC3-0 ratio among the three groups. The workflow of intact protein analysis using full scan HRMS established in this current work can be potentially extended to relative quantitation of other glycosylated proteins. To our best knowledge, this is the first time that a systematic approach of relative quantitation of targeted intact protein glycoisoforms using LC-MS has been established and utilized in biomarker research.",

In chronic disease, failure to regenerate parenchymal tissue leads to the replacement of lost cellular mass with a fibrotic matrix. The mechanisms that dictate the balance of cell regeneration and fibrogenesis are not well understood. Here we report that fibrogenic hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) in the liver are negative regulators of hepatocyte regeneration. This negative regulatory function requires stimulation of the 5-hydroxytryptamine 2B receptor (5-HT(2B)) on HSCs by serotonin, which activates expression of transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1), a powerful suppressor of hepatocyte proliferation, through signaling by mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (ERK) and the transcription factor JunD. Selective antagonism of 5-HT(2B) enhanced hepatocyte growth in models of acute and chronic liver injury. We also observed similar effects in mice lacking 5-HT(2B) or JunD or upon selective depletion of HSCs in wild-type mice. Antagonism of 5-HT(2B) attenuated fibrogenesis and improved liver function in disease models in which fibrosis was pre-established and progressive. Pharmacological targeting of 5-HT(2B) is clinically safe in humans and may be therapeutic in chronic liver disease.",

Reduced aqueous tear flow and/or increased evaporation of the aqueous tear phase leads to tear hyperosmolarity, a key step in the vicious circle of DED pathology. Tear hyperosmolarity gives rise to morphological changes such as apoptosis of cells of the conjunctiva and cornea, and triggers inflammatory cascades that contribute to further cell death, including loss of mucin-producing goblet cells. This exacerbates tear film instability and drives the cycle of events that perpetuate the condition. Traditional approaches to counteracting tear hyperosmolarity in DED include use of hypotonic tear substitutes, which have relatively short persistence in the eye. More recent attempts to counteract tear hyperosmolarity in DED have included osmoprotectants, small organic molecules that are used in many cell types throughout the natural world to restore cell volume and stabilize protein function, allowing adaptation to hyperosmolarity. There is now an expanding pool of clinical data on the efficacy of DED therapies that include osmoprotectants such as erythritol, taurine, trehalose and L-carnitine. Osmoprotectants in DED may directly protect cells against hyperosmolarity and thereby promote exit from the vicious circle of DED physiopathology. ",

Investigating the genes and signaling pathways that regulate lung growth has led to significant insights into the pathogenesis of congenital and adult lung disease.

Although there are no perfect animal models of any psychiatric disorder, models do exist for many elements of each disease state or stage. In many cases, the development of certain models is essentially restricted to the human clinical laboratory domain for the purpose of maximizing validity, whereas the use of in vitro models may best represent an adjunctive, well-controlled means to model specific signaling mechanisms associated with psychiatric disease states. The data generated by preclinical models are only as valid as the model itself, and the development and refinement of animal models for human psychiatric disorders continues to be an important challenge.

Data from the National Latino and Asian American Study showed that Asian immigrants (n=1491) with multiple strong reasons to migrate were less likely to suffer from mental health problems (i.e., psychological distress and psychiatric disorders in the past 12 months) than those without clear goals. Moreover, Asian immigrants with adequate migratory planning had lower levels of distress and lower rates of 12-month psychiatric disorders than those with poorly planned migration. Compared with migrants of the youngest age category (six or younger), those who migrated during preteen and adolescent years without clear goals had higher levels of psychological distress, and those who migrated during adulthood (25 years or older) were less likely to suffer from recent depressive disorders (with the exception of those migrating for life-improving goals). Furthermore, we found that well-planned migration lowered acculturative stress, and multiple strong reasons for migration buffered the negative effect of acculturative stress upon mental health. Findings from this study advance research on immigrant health from the life course perspective by highlighting the effects of exercising human agency during the pre-migration stage upon post-migration mental health.",

The aim of this study was to investigate conditioned disgust responses, its potential overlap with conditioned fear responses (CRs) and the influence of disgust sensitivity on blood oxygen level-dependent responses. Yet even though current studies report evidence that disgust sensitivity is a vulnerability factor, the knowledge about the underlying neural mechanisms remains very limited. Two groups were exposed either to a disgust- or a fear-conditioning paradigm. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we identified a conjoint activated network including the cingulate cortex, the nucleus accumbens, the orbitofrontal cortex, and the occipital cortex within the disgust- and the fear-conditioning group. Moreover, we report evidence of increased insula activation in the disgust-conditioning group. In addition, functional connectivity analysis revealed increased interconnections, most pronounced within the insula in the high disgust sensitivity group compared with the low disgust sensitivity group. The conjunction results suggest that the conditioned responses in disgust and fear conditioning recruit the same neural network, implicating that different conditioned responses of aversive learning depend on a common neural network. Increased insula activation within the disgust-conditioning group might be attributable to heightened interoceptive processes, which might be more pronounced in disgust. Finally, the findings regarding disgust sensitivity are discussed with respect to vulnerability factors for certain psychiatric disorders.",

Parkinson's disease is a complex disorder that strongly affects patients' quality of life. Several health-related quality of life tools have been used in Parkinson's disease. A Movement Disorder Society Task Force was commissioned to rate the psychometric quality of available health-related quality of life scales as applied to Parkinson's disease. Following the methodology adopted by previous work of the Movement Disorder Society Task Force, a review of generic and specific health-related quality of life scales applied in studies on Parkinson's disease was completed. Considering the scales from 3 perspectives-use in Parkinson's disease, use by multiple research groups, and clinimetric properties-a final classification as \"recommended,\" \"suggested,\" or \"listed\" was applied to each reviewed instrument. Four generic scales (EuroQoL, Nottingham Health Profile, 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey, and Sickness Impact Profile) and 5 specific scales (39-Item Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire, Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire Short Form, Parkinson's Disease Quality of Life Questionnaire, Parkinson's Impact Scale, and Scales for Outcomes in Parkinson's Disease-Psychosocial) reached the level of \"recommended.\" The 39-item Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire is the most thoroughly tested and applied questionnaire. Three other generic measures (Quality of Life Questionnaire 15D, Schedule for the Evaluation of Individual Quality of Life-Direct Weighting, and World Health Organization Quality of Life Assessment Short Version) and the specific Parkinson's Disease Quality of Life Scale are \"suggested.\" With a little additional effort in completing the stipulated requirements, they could reach the \"recommended\" level. At present there is a wide variety of health-related quality of life measures for application in the Parkinson's disease setting, and the task force does not recommend the development of a new scale. Selection of the most appropriate instrument for a particular objective requires consideration of the characteristics of each scale and the goals of the assessment.",

Movement of animals between farms is one of the most significant routes of disease transmission and is particularly hard to control for pathogens with subclinical infection. Renibacterium salmoninarum causes bacterial kidney disease (BKD) in salmonid fish, but infection is often sub-clinical and may go undetected with major potential implications for disease control programmes. A Susceptible-Infected model of R. salmoninarum in Scottish aquaculture has been developed that subdivides the infected phase between known and undetected sub-clinically infected farms and diseased farms whose status is assumed to be known. Farms officially known to be infected are subject to movement controls restricting spread of infection. Model results are sensitive to prevalence of undetected infection, which is unknown. However, the modelling suggests that controls that reduce BKD prevalence include improve biosecurity on farms, including those not known to be infected, and improved detection of infection. Culling appears of little value for BKD control. BKD prevalence for rainbow trout farms is less sensitive to controls than it is for Atlantic salmon farms and so different management strategies may be required for the sectors.",

The production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), particularly superoxide, is an important host defence mechanism for killing invading pathogens. However, excessive superoxide may be detrimental following influenza A virus infection. Indeed, suppression of superoxide production by targeting the primary enzymatic source of superoxide in mammalian inflammatory cells, NADPH oxidase 2 (Nox2), markedly alleviates influenza A virus-induced lung injury and virus replication, irrespective of the infecting strain. Therefore, we propose that Nox2 oxidase inhibitors, in combination with current therapeutics (i.e. antivirals and vaccines), could be useful for suppression of influenza A virus-induced lung disease.",

Here we examined whether individuals with WS also have difficulties in visually controlling whole-body movements. We investigated visual control of stepping down at a change of level in children with WS (5-16-year-olds), who descended a single step while their movement was kinematically recorded. On each trial step height was set unpredictably, so that visual information was necessary to perceive the step depth and position the legs appropriately before landing. Kinematic measures established that children with WS did not use visual information to slow the leg at an appropriate point during the step. This pattern contrasts with that observed in typically developing 3- and 4-year-old children, implying severe impairment in whole-body visuomotor control in WS. For children with WS, performance was not significantly predicted by low-level visual or balance problems, but improved significantly with verbal age. The results suggest some plasticity and development in WS whole-body control. These data clearly show that visuospatial and visuomotor deficits in WS extend to the locomotor domain. Taken together with evidence for parietal and cerebellar abnormalities in WS, these results also provide new evidence for the role of these circuits in the visual control of whole-body movement.",

We have previously shown that prenatal exposure to nicotine, the major psychoactive component in cigarette smoke, alters myelin gene expression in the CNS of adolescent rats. To examine whether this effect is specific for adolescents, we examined myelin gene expression in the CNS of juveniles and adults. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with nicotine (3 mg/kg/day; GN) or saline (GS) via osmotic mini pumps from gestational days 4-18. Both male and female offspring were sacrificed at postnatal day P20-21 (juveniles), P35-36 (adolescents), or P59-60 (adults). Three limbic brain regions, the prefrontal cortex (PFC), caudate putamen (CPu), and nucleus accumbens (NAc), were dissected. The expression of genes encoding major myelin components was evaluated using quantitative RT-PCR. We found that GN altered myelin gene expression in juveniles with brain region and sex differences. The pattern of alteration was different from that observed in adolescents. Although these genes were expressed normally in male adults, we observed decreased expression in GN-treated female adults, especially in the CPu. Thus, GN altered myelin gene expression throughout postnatal development and adulthood. The effect on adolescents was quite different from that at other ages, which correlated with the unique symptoms of many psychiatric disorders during adolescence.",

The degree of fibrosis is equivalent to the liver stiffness measured in kilopascal (kPa). It is frequently used in adult patients with a mean normal stiffness of 4.4-5.5 kPa. Since 2008, liver stiffness can be measured even in small children and infants following the availability of a new probe with a smaller diameter (S-probe 5 mm) than the regular probe (M-probe 7 mm). We report control values for healthy children between 0 and 18 years and investigated the feasibility of this technique in a pediatric population. For control values, TE was performed in infants and children after exclusion of liver disease by medical history, clinical examination, blood investigation, and abdominal ultrasound. For feasibility analyses the results of all TE performed in our clinic were analyzed irrespective of the underlying disease. Liver stiffness was measured with the S-probe (thorax diameter <45 cm (S1) or 45-75 cm (S2)) and the M-probe (thorax diameter >75 cm) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. A total of 240 healthy children were analyzed to establish control values. The median liver stiffness was 4.7 kPa resulting in an upper limit of normal of 6.47 kPa. Median values of stiffness were significantly age dependent with 4.40, 4.73, and 5.1 kPa in children 0-5, 6-11, and 12-18 years (p = 0.001) while the interquartile range decreased with age (0.8, 0.7, and 0.6 kPa). The resulting upper limit of normal (median plus 1.64 times standard deviation) was 5.96, 6.65, and 6.82 kPa. Girls between 11 and 18 years showed a significantly lower median stiffness than boys of the same age (4.7 vs. 5.6 kPa; p < 0.005). Feasibility was tested in 975 consecutive liver stiffness measurements (LSM) in children 0-18 years of age. Patients with invalid LSM were significantly younger than those with valid LSM (5.8 vs. 9.7 years, p < 0.0001), showed a significantly higher stiffness (10.2 vs. 6.17, p < 0.0001), and examinations took significantly longer (202 vs. 160 s, p < 0.0001). TE is technically possible in children of all age groups. The upper limit of normal increases significantly with age. Due to movement artifacts the measurement is reliable from the age of 6 without sedation. In younger children the number of invalid measurements increases significantly. Further studies are needed to asses the value of TE in the diagnosis and follow-up of liver disease in pediatric hepatology.",

However, ELISA measures bacterial antigen, which does not necessarily reflect the number of cells present. We hypothesized that dual analysis of kidney tissue by ELISA and a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction assay (qPCR) would provide complementary information about antigen level and the number of bacterial genomes. We found that DNA extracted from the insoluble fraction of the ELISA tissue preparation produced the same qPCR result as DNA extracted directly from frozen tissue, permitting true dual analysis of the same tissue sample. We examined kidney tissue in this manner from individual free-ranging juvenile Chinook salmon and antibiotic-treated captive subadult Chinook salmon and observed 3 different patterns of results. Among the majority of fish, there was a strong correlation between the ELISA value and the qPCR value. However, subsets of fish exhibited either low ELISA values with elevated qPCR values or higher ELISA values with very low qPCR values. These observations suggest a conceptual model that allows inferences about the state of infection of individual fish based on dual ELISA/qPCR results. Although this model requires further assessment through experimental infections and treatments, it may have utility in broodstock selection programs that currently apply egg-culling practices based on ELISA alone.",

Specifically, many areas of medicine use objective measures of an organ's function or characteristic to guide clinical management of particular subjective complaints.

        "medline_abstract_text":"The development of therapeutic approaches to treat lung disease requires an understanding of both the normal and disease physiology of the lung. Although traditional experimental approaches only address either organ or cellular physiology, the use of lung slice preparations provides a unique approach to investigate integrated physiology that links the cellular and organ responses. Living lung slices are robust and can be prepared from a variety of species, including humans, and they retain many aspects of the cellular and structural organization of the lung. Functional portions of intrapulmonary airways, arterioles and veins are present within the alveoli parenchyma. The dynamics of macroscopic changes of contraction and relaxation associated with the airways and vessels are readily observed with conventional low-magnification microscopy. The microscopic changes associated with cellular events, that determine the macroscopic responses, can be observed with confocal or two-photon microscopy. To investigate disease processes, lung slices can either be prepared from animal models of disease or animals exposed to disease invoking conditions. Alternatively, the lung slices themselves can be experimentally manipulated. Because of the ability to observe changes in cell physiology and how these responses manifest themselves at the level of the organ, lung slices have become a standard tool for the investigation of lung disease.",

Unfortunately, liver biopsy continues to be the gold standard for the staging and grading of fibrosis. Liver biopsy is an invasive and painful technique with several limitations. These limitations have led to the development of alternative noninvasive methods for the accurate assessment of fibrosis and for the maintenance of an acceptable risk/benefit ratio. In the last decades, transient elastography (TE) has received increasing consideration as a means of evaluating disease progression in paediatric chronic liver disease. TE is an accurate and reproducible methodology for identifying subjects without fibrosis or significant fibrosis, or with advanced fibrosis. In this review, we provide an outline of liver fibrosis in paediatric liver diseases, including fibrogenesis, and noninvasive techniques for the diagnosis and follow-up of fibrosis, and then focus on the characteristics of TE and on its strength in the assessment of liver fibrosis, paying particular attention to studies conducted in children.",

The progression of the disease is well characterized; however, although the progression of alcohol-induced liver injury is well characterized, there is no universally-accepted therapy available to halt or reverse this process in humans. With better understanding of the mechanism(s) and risk factors that mediate the initiation and progression of this disease, rational targeted therapy can be developed to treat or prevent it in the clinics. Several models for experimental ALD exist, including non-human primates, micropigs and rodents. However, most researchers employ rodent models of ALD. Furthermore, the advent of genetically modified strains of rodents (e.g. 'knockout' mice) has increased the specificity of the hypotheses that can be directly tested. Based on these models systems, several plausible hypotheses to explain the mechanism(s) by which alcohol leads to liver damage have been proposed, including consequences of alcohol metabolism, oxidative/nitrosative stress, altered inflammatory responses, and increased sensitivity to cytotoxic stimuli. These studies have also identified candidate genes for polymorphism studies to explain potential increased genetic risk in some individuals. However, despite significant advances in our understanding of the mechanisms by which ALD develops based on studies with these models, this work has yet to translate to a viable therapy for ALD in the clinics. This talk will also discuss potential reasons for these limitations to date and suggest future prospects to improve the translational utility of modeling ALD.",

        "medline_abstract_text":"Zinc deficiency is one of the most consistent nutritional/biochemical observations in alcoholic liver disease (ALD). The objectives of our research are to determine how alcohol interferes with cellular zinc homeostasis and if zinc deficiency is a causal factor in the development of ALD. Metallothionein (MT) is a major protein responsible for cellular zinc homeostasis. MT-transgenic (MT-TG) mice with hepatic overexpression of MT and elevation of zinc level were resistant to ethanol-induced liver injury. MT-knockout (MT-KO) mice with a reduction of hepatic zinc were more susceptible to alcohol toxicity. However, zinc treatment also provided beneficial effects on alcohol hepatoxicity in MT-KO mice, suggesting a MT-independent action. Dietary zinc supplementation normalized hepatic zinc level and attenuated the pathological changes in the liver of mice chronically fed alcohol. Several mechanisms were involved in zinc action against alcoholic cytotoxicity. Zinc enhanced cellular antioxidant capacity and corrected alcohol metabolic switch from alcohol dehydrogenase to cytochrome P4502E1. Zinc attenuated cytokine production and TNF-α receptor- and Fas-mediated cell death pathways. Zinc restored activities of hepatocyte nuclear factor-4α (HNF-4α) and peroxisome proliferation activator-α (PPAR-α), and enhanced hepatic fatty acid β-oxidation and lipid secretion. Hepatoma cell cultures showed that zinc deprivation induces lipid accumulation via inactivating HNF-4α and PPAR-α. These results suggest that alcohol exposure interferes with hepatic zinc homeostasis, leading to cellular zinc deprivation. Inactivation of zinc proteins due to zinc release is likely an important molecular mechanism in the pathogenesis of ALD.",

Our data showed substantial behavioral changes in the open field test, but limited effects in the elevated plus maze. The findings suggested that single and repeated stress exposure may have different consequences, that the effects of stress exposure may develop over time and persist for an extended period, and that both direct and indirect stressed rats displayed a hyposensitive HPA axis following acute restraint stress. Overall our observations moderately indicate direct exposure to elicit behavioral changes, and both direct and indirect exposure to stress to result in aberrations within the neuroendocrine system.

In rodents, treatment with NK-2 receptor agonists causes anxiogenic effects, while NK-2 receptor antagonists show anxiolytic and antidepressant-like effects. However, information about the distribution and functions of NK-2 receptors in the central nervous system (CNS) in primates is still lacking. Here, we examined the distribution and pharmacological profile of NK-2 receptors in the rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta) to clarify the molecular basis of NK-2-mediated tachykininergic functions in the primate CNS. NK-2 receptors cloned from the rhesus monkey brain showed similar pharmacological properties to those of human NK-2 receptors. Substantial expression levels of NK-2 mRNA were observed in all the brain regions examined, including areas pertinent to the emotional networks such as the prefrontal cortex, cingulate cortex and amygdala. These findings suggest that NK-2 receptors may play important roles in the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders.",

The aims of the study were to find the prevalence in use of alcohol, drugs, benzodiazepines, hypnotics, opiates and stimulants, and to find the prevalence of substance use disorders at admission to an acute psychiatric department receiving all admissions from a catchment area. Patients were interviewed about use of medications and intoxicating substances during the last week before admission in 227 consecutive admissions. Urine samples were analysed with the liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry (LC-MS) method. Use of substances was determined from reported use and findings in urine samples. Diagnoses were set at discharge according to ICD-10 research criteria. In 81.9% of the admissions, the patient had used alcohol, drugs, benzodiazepines, hypnotics, opiates or stimulants prior to admission. More men used alcohol, cannabis and stimulants, whereas more women used benzodiazepines. In 31.7% of the admissions, 49.5% of men and 16.4% of women, the patients had a substance use disorder (ICD-10, F10-19). Patients with substance use disorders had a shorter stay in hospital than other patients, and patients with no psychiatric disorder other than substance use disorders had a median length of stay of 2 days.

The material covered all suicides and undetermined deaths 1945-2004 in the Faroe Islands (a low-incidence population) and the study made use of all available information. Results showed that suicide rate had been low since the Second World War. However, there was an increase throughout the 1970s and 1980s. Supposed core features of suicide, such as gender, marital status, former psychiatric admittance, former suicidal behaviour, alcohol and method preference were confirmed. Others were not, such as an increasing rate with old age. In diagnostics, the role of psychiatric disorders was confirmed, but so was a substantial role of \"no disorder\". Increase period revealed a high proportion of cases with alcohol involved and a substantial part included males, in age groups 25-64 years, unmarried, divorced and alcohol intoxicated. The main conclusion was that a low-incidence population of suicide population confirmed some supposed core features of the suicide phenomenon. Others, related to age and psychiatric disorders, were only partially confirmed. In periods of increase, the most vulnerable were the young and middle-aged males, unmarried, divorced, and alcohol played a crucial role.",

The instruments used were the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) for parents and the Teacher Report Form (TRF). No ethnic differences were found on competence scales. Total Problems reported by Sami and Norwegian mothers were low in comparison with the overall mean found in multicultural meta-studies. Sami mothers reported lower Total Problems and Attention Problems than did Norwegian mothers. There were no ethnic differences on the TRF measures. Consistent with other international studies, mothers and teachers rated girls higher than boys on social competence and boys higher than girls on Externalizing and Attention Problems. Gender differences were larger on the TRF than on the CBCL.

This has raised expectations that therapy of genetic or acquired liver disease might be possible by transplanting stem/progenitor cells or their liver-committed progeny. However, it is currently impossible to determine from the many documented studies which of the stem/progenitor cell populations are the best for therapy of a given disease. This is largely because of the great variability in methods used to characterise cells and their differentiation ability, variability in transplantation models and inconsistent methods to determine the effect of cell grafting in vivo. This manuscript represents a first proposal, created by a group of investigators ranging from basic biologists to clinical hepatologists. It aims to define standardised methods to assess stem/progenitor cells or their hepatic lineage-committed progeny that could be used for cell therapy in liver disease. Furthermore standardisation is suggested both for preclinical animal models to evaluate the ability of such cells to repopulate the liver functionally, and for the ongoing clinical trials using mature hepatocytes. Only when these measures have been put in place will the promise of stem/progenitor-derived hepatocyte-based therapies become reality.",

Persisting abnormalities of bone turnover and abnormal mineralization, together with bone mineral density (BMD) loss from glucocorticoids, may all predispose to a loss of structural integrity and increased fracture risk in kidney and kidney pancreas recipients. Vitamin D, calcitriol, calcitonin and bisphosphonates have all been used to preserve BMD following transplantation, despite a lack of safety data and the potential for some of these drugs to cause harm. A limited number of post-transplant studies utilizing these drugs have not yet documented improved fracture prevention or fracture-related mortality and have not considered allocation based on risk factors for fracture or markers of bone turnover. Targeted allocation of the available therapies based on a stratification of risk appears warranted. This might be achieved using an algorithm incorporating BMD, X-ray evaluation, laboratory investigations including bone turnover markers and the assessment of standard fracture risk factors at the time of and soon after transplantation. This approach, which is similar to protocols used in the general population, may result in more effective management of patients and fewer adverse effects such as adynamic bone disease. Although BMD is a surrogate for fracture risk in the general population it is not validated in this transplant population. Consequently, such an approach should be confirmed by studies that include bone biopsy data and an evaluation of patient level outcomes.",

To extend understanding, an investigation was made of the association of resistance to proliferative kidney disease (PKD) in 4 second filial generation (F2) families of Atlantic salmon with molecular markers from different genetic linkage groups in the species' genome, following a natural disease outbreak. PKD causes serious mortality in cultured salmonids. In addition to mortality, associations with growth-related traits were also examined, as immune responses are energetically costly and have been observed to reduce growth. Associations were investigated for 34 microsatellite markers and 5 restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) loci from 3 regions of the growth hormone 1 gene (GH1). The phenotypic and genotypic character of survivors was compared with unexposed fish derived from the same families. Mortality was not size-selective, but growth in the survivors was reduced, and fish had a lower condition factor than unexposed fish, suggesting an energetic cost to resistance. Five markers showed significant allele frequency differences between survivors and unexposed fish, albeit in single families. Prior to correction for multiple tests, 2 of these markers were also linked to variation in growth-related traits among survivors, along with a further 7 markers. Though sample sizes constrained the power of the analysis, the study points to regions of the salmon genome that may contain quantitative trait loci related to PKD resistance, on which further work on the genetic architecture of PKD resistance in this species could focus.",

Herein, we use proteomics to determine whether the hepatoprotective action of SAM against early-stage alcoholic liver disease is linked to alterations in the mitochondrial proteome. For this, male rats were fed control or ethanol-containing liquid diets +/- SAM and liver mitochondria were prepared for proteomic analysis. Two-dimensional isoelectric focusing (2D IEF/SDS-PAGE) and blue native gel electrophoresis (BN-PAGE) were used to determine changes in matrix and oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) proteins, respectively. SAM coadministration minimized alcohol-dependent inflammation and preserved mitochondrial respiration. SAM supplementation preserved liver SAM levels in ethanol-fed rats; however, mitochondrial SAM levels were increased by ethanol and SAM treatments. With use of 2D IEF/SDS-PAGE, 30 proteins showed significant changes in abundance in response to ethanol, SAM, or both. Classes of proteins affected by ethanol and SAM treatments were chaperones, beta oxidation proteins, sulfur metabolism proteins, and dehydrogenase enzymes involved in methionine, glycine, and choline metabolism. BN-PAGE revealed novel changes in the levels of 19 OxPhos proteins in response to ethanol, SAM, or both. Ethanol- and SAM-dependent alterations in the proteome were not linked to corresponding changes in gene expression. In conclusion, ethanol and SAM treatment led to multiple changes in the liver mitochondrial proteome. The protective effects of SAM against alcohol toxicity are mediated, in part, through maintenance of proteins involved in key mitochondrial energy conserving and biosynthetic pathways. This study demonstrates that SAM may be a promising candidate for treatment of alcoholic liver disease.",

Recent studies have established the role of these facultative progenitor cells in injury repair and fibrosis in patients with chronic liver disease and in experimental models. Several signaling pathways linking progenitor cell activation and fibrosis have been identified, and there is increasing evidence that cross-talk (both physical and via soluble factors) between progenitor cells and myofibroblasts is essential for both fibrosis and parenchymal regeneration. Even more exciting are new data examining the cellular components of the progenitor cell niche, demonstrating that both resident liver cells and circulating cells from the bone marrow can function as stem cells, suggesting that there is a surprising degree of phenotypic plasticity such that progenitor cells can contribute to the myofibroblast population and vice versa. We highlight here recent findings from the literature demonstrating the cellular and functional complexity of the progenitor cell niche, and emphasize some of the important questions that remain to drive future research.",

Based on reports that inherited copy number variations (CNVs) modulate some GST gene expression levels, and that the small airway epithelium (SAE) and alveolar macrophages (AMs) are involved early in the pathogenesis of smoking-induced lung disease, we asked: do germline CNVs modulate GST expression levels in SAE and AMs? Microarrays were used to survey GST gene expression and determine CNVs genotypes in SAE and AMs obtained by bronchoscopy from current smokers and nonsmokers. 26% of subjects were null for both GSTM1 alleles, with reduced GSTM1 mRNA levels seen in both SAE and AMs. 30% of subjects had homozygous deletions of GSTT1, with reduced mRNA levels in both tissues. Interestingly, GSTT2B exhibited homozygous deletion in the blood of 27% of subjects and was not expressed in SAE in the remainder of subjects, but was expressed in AMs of heterozygotes and wild-type subjects, proportionate to genotype. These data show a germline CNV-mediated linear relationship of genotype with expression level, suggesting minimal compensation of gene expression levels in heterozygotes, consistent with GST polymorphisms playing a role in the risk of smoking-associated, xenobiotic-induced lung disease.",

The ASL comprises a superficial mucus layer (ML) overlying a periciliary fluid layer (PCL) that contacts surface epithelial cells. We measured viscosity of the ML and PCL from the diffusion of FITC-dextran dissolved in the ASL of unperturbed, well-differentiated primary cultures of human bronchial epithelia grown at an air-liquid interface. Diffusion was measured by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, using a perfluorocarbon immersion lens and confocal fluorescence detection. Bleaching of an in-plane 6-μm-wide region was done in which diffusion coefficients were computed using solution standards of specified viscosity and finite-element computations of 2-layer dye diffusion in 3 dimensions. We found remarkably elevated viscosity in both ML and PCL of CF vs. non-CF bronchial epithelial cell cultures. Relative viscosities (with saline=1) were in the range 7-10 in the non-CF ML and PCL, and 25-30 in both ML and PCL in CF, and greatly reduced by amiloride treatment or mucin washout. These data indicate that the CF airway surface epithelium, even without hyperviscous secretions from submucosal glands, produces an intrinsically hyperviscous PCL and ML, which likely contributes to CF lung disease by impairment of mucociliary clearance. Our results challenge the view that the PCL is a relatively watery, nonviscous fluid layer in contact with a more viscous ML, and offer an explanation for CF lung disease in the gland-free lower airways.",

In this study, we induced liver fibrosis using dimethylnitrosamine (DMN) in NOD/SCID mice to create an animal model for liver disease. DMN (5 mg/kg, i.p.) was injected intraperitoneally for three consecutive days per week for 6 or 8 weeks, and the mice were sacrificed at weeks 0, 4 and 8 after the last DMN injection. The 6-week DMN-treated group gradually recovered from serum biochemical changes, histopathological toxic effects and lesions in the liver at weeks 4 and 8 after the last DMN injection. However, the progression of liver fibrosis and toxic levels were maintained in the 8-week DMN-treated group at week 4 after the last DMN injection. The increases in iron and extracellular matrix (collagen) in the DMN-treated group were confirmed by Prussian blue (PB) and Masson's trichrome (MT) staining, respectively. Additionally, activation of hepatic stellate cells was observed by alpha smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) immunostaining and western blot. In conclusion, treatment of NOD/SCID mice with 5 mg/kg of DMN for 8 weeks can be used to induce an appropriate animal model of disease for liver fibrosis. This model may be useful for evaluation of the efficacy and safety of cell therapies such as human mesenchymal stem cell therapy.",

        "medline_abstract_text":"Family and twin studies suggest that a range of neurocognitive traits index the inherited liability to ADHD; however, the utility of such measures as endophenotypes in molecular genetic studies remains largely untested. The current article examined whether the inclusion of neurocognitive measures in a genomewide linkage analysis of ADHD could aid in identifying QTL linked to the behavioral symptoms of the condition. Data were from an affected sibling pair linkage study of DSM-IV ADHD conducted at Massachusetts General Hospital. The sample included 1,212 individuals from 271 families. ADHD symptoms were assessed with the K-SADS-E. The neurocognitive battery included Wechsler Intelligence Scales subtests, the Stroop, the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), the Rey-Osterreith Complex Figure, a working memory CPT, the CVLT and WRAT-III subscales. Evidence for linkage was assessed using a simulation-based method that combines information from univariate analyses into the equivalent of a multivariate test. After correction for multiple trait testing, a region on chromosome 3q13 showed suggestive linkage to all neurocognitive traits examined and inattention symptoms of ADHD. The second highest peak occurred on 22q12 but showed linkage to a single subscale of the WCST. In univariate analysis, this region retained criteria for suggestive linkage to this measure after correction for multiple trait testing. Our primary findings raise the possibility that one or more genes on 3q13 influence neurocognitive functions and behavioral symptoms of inattention. Overall, these data support the utility of neurocognitive traits as ADHD endophenotypes, but also highlight their limited genetic overlap with the disorder.",

Understanding the pathogenesis of this disease has been hindered, however, by the lack of an animal model with characteristic features of CF. To overcome this problem, we recently generated pigs with mutated CFTR genes. We now report that, within months of birth, CF pigs spontaneously developed hallmark features of CF lung disease, including airway inflammation, remodeling, mucus accumulation, and infection. Their lungs contained multiple bacterial species, suggesting that the lungs of CF pigs have a host defense defect against a wide spectrum of bacteria. In humans, the temporal and causal relations between inflammation and infection have remained uncertain. To investigate these processes, we studied newborn pigs. Their lungs showed no inflammation but were less often sterile than controls. Moreover, after introduction of bacteria into their lungs, pigs with CF failed to eradicate bacteria as effectively as wild-type pigs. These results suggest that impaired bacterial elimination is the pathogenic event that initiates a cascade of inflammation and pathology in CF lungs. Our finding that pigs with CF have a host defense defect against bacteria within hours of birth provides an opportunity to further investigate CF pathogenesis and to test therapeutic and preventive strategies that could be deployed before secondary consequences develop.",

Given the progress in CF therapy and the consecutive improvement in prognosis, monitoring of disease progression and effectiveness of therapeutic interventions with repeated imaging of the CF lung plays an increasingly important role. So far, the chest radiograph has been the most widely used imaging modality to monitor morphological changes in the CF lung. CT is the gold standard for assessment of morphological changes of airways and lung parenchyma. Considering the necessity of life-long repeated imaging studies, the cumulative radiation doses reached with CT is problematic for CF patients. A sensitive, non-invasive and quantitative technique without radiation exposure is warranted for monitoring of disease activity. In previous studies, MRI proved to be comparable to CT regarding the detection of morphological changes in the CF lung without using ionising radiation. Furthermore, MRI was shown to be superior to CT regarding assessment of functional changes of the lung. This review presents the typical morphological and functional MR imaging findings with respect to MR-based follow-up of CF lung disease. MRI offers a variety of techniques for morphological and functional imaging of the CF lung. Using this radiation free technique short- and long-term follow-up studies are possible enabling an individualised guidance of the therapy.",

The objective of our study was to evaluate efficacy, pharmacokinetics and safety of unboosted atazanavir in HIV-infected patients with ESLD screened for orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT(x)). Patients and methods Single-arm, 24 week pilot study. Atazanavir-naive patients undergoing highly active antiretroviral therapy were switched to atazanavir 400 mg/day plus two non-thymidine nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Results Fifteen patients (10 males and 5 females) were included. In the study period, 2 patients were transplanted and 10 completed 24 weeks of atazanavir treatment. Median area under the concentration-time curve at week 4 was 19 211 ng.h/mL (IQR = 8959-27 500). At week 24, median atazanavir trough concentrations (C(trough)) per patient calculated across the study were above the minimum effective concentration (MEC = 100 ng/mL) in 8 of 10 subjects. Atazanavir C(trough) time-point values were always above the MEC in five patients. The other three subjects experienced only one determination below the MEC, with median atazanavir C(trough) levels across the study being above the MEC in two of them. At 8 of 11 time-points when atazanavir and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) were co-administered and at 16 of 19 time-points in which patients had a concomitant tenofovir association, atazanavir C(trough) was above the MEC. Conclusions Unboosted atazanavir showed a favourable pharmacokinetic profile and was able to maintain or gain immuno-virological eligibility for OLT(x) in all patients. Limited biochemical toxicities (including unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia) and allowance of concomitant administration of tenofovir and PPIs were observed.",

We calculated the MELD score (pre-MELD) and consecutive postoperative MELD (post-MELD) scores computed daily during the first postoperative week and on days 15 and 30 after OLT. Post-MELD scores from nonsurviving recipients displayed on a scatterplot of immediate probability of death were adjusted to the best goodness-of-fit curve, and, finally, depicted graphically as a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Nonsurviving recipients showed higher post-MELD scores: day 1: 23.5 versus 16.6 (P = .05); day 3: 25.1 versus 12.5 (P = .000); day 5: 25.7 versus 11.8 (P = .000); and day 7: 22.1 versus 10.2 (P = .000). Overall comparisons were performed using a time-dependent general linear regression model, revealing higher post-MELD scores for nonsurviving recipients, irrespective of postoperative time (P = .002). The best goodness-of-fit curve was displayed when adjusting to a theoretical exponential regression curve calculated as follows: Probability of dying within the first week (%) = 3.36 x e(0.079 x (post-MELD)) (r = .89; P = .000). The area under the ROC curve was 0.783 (95% confidence interval, 0.630-0.935; P = .001). The model had a positive predictive value of 82.3%, a negative predictive value of 33.1%, and an accuracy of 79.2%.

This paper first briefly discusses the unique history of human hallucinogen research, and then reviews the risks of hallucinogen administration and safeguards for minimizing these risks. Although hallucinogens are relatively safe physiologically and are not considered drugs of dependence, their administration involves unique psychological risks. The most likely risk is overwhelming distress during drug action ('bad trip'), which could lead to potentially dangerous behaviour such as leaving the study site. Less common are prolonged psychoses triggered by hallucinogens. Safeguards against these risks include the exclusion of volunteers with personal or family history of psychotic disorders or other severe psychiatric disorders, establishing trust and rapport between session monitors and volunteer before the session, careful volunteer preparation, a safe physical session environment and interpersonal support from at least two study monitors during the session. Investigators should probe for the relatively rare hallucinogen persisting perception disorder in follow-up contact. Persisting adverse reactions are rare when research is conducted along these guidelines. Incautious research may jeopardize participant safety and future research.

There are some models for this disease, most of them being conceptual. So, it seems that considering all physiological information and structural specifications to develop a holistic model is needed. We introduce a computational model based on experimental and physiological findings. Parts of the brain known to be involved in Huntington's disease are all considered in our model and most features of the movement disorders have been appeared in the model. This mathematical model has considered the involved parts of the brain in a fairly accurate way, explaining the behavior and mechanism of the disease according to the physiological information. Our model has several advantages. It is able to simulate the normal and Huntington's disease stride time intervals. It shows how the present treatment, i.e. diazepam, is able to ameliorate the gait disorder. In this research we assessed the effects of changing some neurotransmitter levels in order to propose new treatments. Although we showed that gamma amino butyric acid (GABA) blockers reduce Huntington's disease movement disorder, but we discussed that it is unfair to use this route for treatment. We evaluated our model response to increment of GABA, alone and observed that the gait disorder was strengthened. Our novel idea in this regard is resuscitation of BG loop in order to maintain its major physiological functions, and at the same time raising the threshold in order to weaken the internal disturbances. Our last idea about BG treatment is to decrease glutamate. Our model was able to show the effectiveness of this treatment on Huntington's disease disturbances. We propose that experimental studies should be designed in which these two novel methods of treatment will be evaluated. This validation would implement a milestone in treatment of such a debilitating disease at Huntington.",

In the present study we aimed to examine the effect of epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) on iron overload of ALD and to explore the potential mechanisms involved in its protection against ALD in mice. Male C57BL/6J mice were given alcohol by intragastric administration for 12 weeks. At the end of 8th week, ALD mice were treated for 4 weeks for 10, 20 and 30 mg kg(-1) EGCG by intraperitoneal injection. Liver injuries were assessed by histopathologic examination and Serum Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) levels. Serum iron content, hepatic iron concentration and liver malondialdehyde (MDA) contents were examined. In addition, hepcidin mRNA levels and transferrin (Tf) and transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) protein levels of liver tissue were also evaluated. Compared with model group, treatment of ALD mice with EGCG ameliorated liver injuries, decreased serum iron level, hepatic iron levels and liver MDA contents, increased hepcidin mRNA level and decreased Tf and TfR1 protein expression in the liver. The results of our study explain a new point of view that the protective effect of EGCG on ALD is associated with its iron-chelating property. The possible mechanisms are that EGCG affects hepatic iron uptake and inhibits iron absorption in the small intestinal.",

Persistence of fetal spermatogonial characteristics was implicated in the emergence of testicular germ cell tumors. The objective of this study was to analyze the tubular architecture in contralateral testes of patients with NSTGCT. We studied morphologic alterations, expression patterns of markers for the integrity of the germinal epithelium (gap junction proteins connexin 43 and 26), as well as of the embryonic markers c-KIT and placental alkaline phosphatase (PlAP), both established markers to detect carcinoma in situ (CIS). In all samples, tubules showing maturation of germ cells up to spermatozoa were observed. In addition, tubules with alterations in tubular architecture and with impaired spermatogenesis occurred. In tubules showing aberrant spermatogenesis, connexin 43 (Cx43) signal was down-regulated and a shift of signal from gap junctions to the cytoplasm occurred. Concomitantly, Cx26 was found highly up-regulated in tubules with incomplete and aberrant germ cell maturation. All testes exhibited single spermatogonia with positive reaction for c-KIT and a significant positive correlation was found between the mean number of c-KIT positive spermatogonia per tubule and the percentage of tubules presenting severely impaired spermatogenesis. Our data show alterations of the normal architecture of the germinal epithelium and disturbances of spermatogenesis in the contralateral testes of patients with NSTGCT in all cases evaluated. The concomitant occurrence of c-KIT positive spermatogonia and defects in tubular architecture is in line with the hypothesis that patients with NSTGCT suffer from disturbed germ cell development.",

The primary pathological issue is a point mutation that renders an abundant hepatic secretory glycoprotein prone to altered folding and a tendency to polymerize and aggregate. However, the expression of serious liver damage among homozygotes is dependent on genetic and/or environmental modifiers. Several studies have validated the concept that endogenous hepatic pathways for disposal of aggregation-prone proteins, including the proteasomal and autophagic degradative pathways, could play a key role in the variation in hepatic damage and be the target of the modifiers. Exciting recent results have shown that a drug that enhances autophagy can reduce the hepatic load of aggregated protein and reverse fibrosis in a mouse model of this disease.",

Further, feces collected from mares at delivery and foals post-partum and monthly thereafter were assayed for L. intracellularis using real-time PCR. Thirty-seven mares (54.4%) had detectable antibody titers (> or =60) against L. intracellularis by IPMA at the time of foaling. Passive transfer of colostral antibodies against L. intracellularis was documented in 37 foals (54.4%) and the colostral antibodies remained detectable in the serum of foals for 1-3 months. Overall, 22 foals (33.3%) showed evidence of natural exposure to L. intracellularis throughout the study period, however, none of the study foals developed signs compatible with EPE. The serological results showed that mares residing on a farm known to be endemic for EPE are routinely exposed to L. intracellularis and that antibodies against L. intracellularis are passively transferred to foals.",

It was found that: 1) proximal stomach distention-induced behavioral changes were mediated by vagal and sympathetic pathways. The total behavior score (TBS) was 40.6 ± 7.4 in the controls, 15.3 ± 8.9 in vagotomized dogs (P=0.006 vs. control) and 8.8 ± 0.9 in the vagotomized dogs with guanethidine (P=0.04 vs. vagotomy). The behavioral changes were mediated via the vagal pathway at distention pressures below 20 mmHg, but mediated via both the vagal and sympathetic pathways at distention pressures equal to and above 20 mmHg. 2) GES with long pulses or dual pulses but not short pulses reduced the distention-induced behavioral score (P=0.003, P=0.006 and P=0.7, respectively) and the effects of GES of long pulses might be mediated via the vagal and sympathetic pathways. In conclusion, gastric distention-induced visceral sensitivity is mediated via the vagal pathway at low distention pressures but via both vagal and sympathetic pathways at high distention pressures. GES with long but not short pulses reduces distention-induced visceral sensitivity.",

MBL binds to glycoconjugates containing mannose, fucose or N-acetylglucosamine that are present in a wide variety of bacteria, viruses and fungi. Upon binding, MBL may active the lectin pathway of complement or directly opsonize organisms to enhance phagocytosis. MBL is primarily a serum protein but accumulates in the lung during acute inflammation. Recent evidence suggests an important role for MBL in a variety of infectious disorders. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a multisystem disease caused by mutations in the gene encoding the CF transmembrane regulator (CFTR). The course of CF lung disease is highly variable even in patients with the same CFTR genotype, suggesting that other modulator genes are important for prognosis. MBL has been proposed as a possible modulator of clinical severity in CF. In this review and meta-analysis, we found that MBL2 genotypes associated with MBL insufficiency were associated with earlier acquisition of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P < 0.0001), reduced pulmonary function among adult patients (P < 0.0001 for forced expiratory volume), and an increased rate of death or requirement for lung transplantation (odds ratio 3.69; P = 0.02). The available evidence therefore suggests that MBL insufficiency is associated with the severity of CF lung disease.

Their functions in lung disease remain unclear. Interleukin-1 family member-9 (IL-1F9) is one such IL-1-like cytokine, expressed in the lungs of humans and mice. IL-1F9 signals through IL-1 receptor-related protein 2 (IL-1Rrp2/IL-1RL2), which is distinct from IL-1RI. We sought to determine if IL-1F9 acts as a proinflammatory cytokine in lung disease. IL-1F9 protein was increased in lung homogenates of house dust mite-challenged A/J mice compared with controls, and expression was seen in airway epithelial cells. The intratracheal administration of recombinant mouse IL-1F9 increased airway hyperresponsiveness and induced neutrophil influx and mucus production, but not eosinophilic infiltration in the lungs of mice. In addition, IL-1α protein levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, chemokines, and chemokine-receptor mRNA expression in the lungs were increased after the instillation of intratracheal IL-1F9. Consistent with these changes, NF-κB transcription factor activity was increased in the lungs of mice challenged with IL-1F9 and in a macrophage cell line treated with IL-1F9. These data suggest that IL-1F9 is upregulated during inflammation, and acts as a proinflammatory cytokine in the lungs.",

        "medline_abstract_text":"Maternal smoking during pregnancy (MS) has long-lasting neurobehavioural effects on the offspring. Many MS-associated psychiatric disorders begin or change symptomatology during adolescence, a period of continuous development of the central nervous system. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. Given that cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) modulate various neurotransmitter systems and are associated with many psychiatric disorders, we hypothesize that CAMs are altered by prenatal treatment of nicotine, the major psychoactive component in tobacco, in adolescent brains. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with nicotine (3 mg/kg.d) or saline via osmotic mini-pumps from gestational days 4 to 18. Female offspring at postnatal day 35 were sacrificed, and several limbic brain regions (the caudate putamen, nucleus accumbens, prefrontal cortex, and amygdala) were dissected for evaluation of gene expression using microarray and quantitative RT-PCR techniques. Various CAMs including neurexin, immunoglobulin, cadherin, and adhesion-GPCR superfamilies, and their intracellular signalling pathways were modified by gestational nicotine treatment (GN). Among the CAM-related pathways, GN has stronger effects on cytoskeleton reorganization pathways than on gene transcription pathways. These effects were highly region dependent, with the caudate putamen showing the greatest vulnerability. Given the important roles of CAMs in neuronal development and synaptic plasticity, our findings suggest that alteration of CAMs contributes to the neurobehavioural deficits associated with MS. Further, our study underscores that low doses of nicotine produce substantial and long-lasting changes in the brain, implying that nicotine replacement therapy during pregnancy may carry many of the same risks to the offspring as MS.",

        "medline_abstract_text":"Liver transplantation is an established treatment for acute and chronic liver disease. However, because of the shortage of donor organs, it does not fulfill the needs of all patients. Hepatocyte transplantation is promising as an alternative method for the treatment of end-stage liver disease and as bridging therapy until liver transplantation. Our group has been working on the optimization of matrix-based hepatocyte transplantation. In order to increase cell survival after transplantation, freshly isolated human hepatocytes were seeded onto biodegradable poly(l-lactic acid) (PLLA) polymer scaffolds and were cultured in a flow bioreactor. PLLA discs were seeded with human hepatocytes and exposed to a recirculated medium flow for 6 days. Human hepatocytes formed spheroidal aggregates with a liver-like morphology and active metabolic function. Phase contrast microscopy showed increasing numbers of spheroids of increasing diameter during the culture period. Hematoxylin and eosin histology showed viable and intact hepatocytes inside the spheroids. Immunohistochemistry confirmed sustained hepatocyte function and a preserved hepatocyte-specific cytoskeleton. Albumin, alpha-1-antitrypsin, and urea assays showed continued production during the culture period. Northern blot analysis demonstrated increasing albumin signals. Scanning electron micrographs showed hepatocyte spheroids with relatively smooth undulating surfaces and numerous microvilli. Transmission electron micrographs revealed intact hepatocytes and junctional complexes with coated pits and vesicles inside the spheroids. Therefore, we conclude that primary human hepatocytes, precultured in a flow bioreactor on a PLLA scaffold, reorganize to form morphologically intact liver neotissue, and this might offer an optimized method for hepatocyte transplantation because of the expected reduction of the initial cell loss, the high regenerative potential in vivo, and the preformed functional integrity.",

However, the long-term survival of kidney transplants still remains relatively poor even under potent immunosuppression. Thus, it is necessary to further review the pathogenesis of renal allograft failure. Here, we discuss the potential impact of activated resident tubular epithelial cells (TECs) on infiltrating leukocyte responses on renal allograft failure. Immunohistochemical staining or in situ hybridization of renal allograft biopsies shows that activated TECs produce inflammatory cytokines and may act as nonprofessional antigen-presenting cells in the response to stimulation from leukocyte infiltration. Further experimental studies confirm that by a feedback loop, activated TECs positively or negatively regulate the destructive activity of infiltrating leukocyte through (1) alteration of leukocyte activation, proliferation, differentiation, and migration to the graft through secretion of cytokines and chemokines; and (2) direct regulation of infiltrating T-cell function through cell-cell contact. Specifically targeting kidney factors has significant impact on renal graft damage or kidney disease. This review suggests that graft TECs can regulate intragraft immune responses, and modulation of specific graft TEC responses as a therapeutic strategy may benefit long-term survival of kidney transplants.",

Because the incidence and prevalence of kidney disease increase with advancing age, nephrologists will be increasingly confronted with a population of patients who are elderly and have a large number of comorbid conditions requiring ongoing care. Furthermore, it is increasingly understood that aging leads to its own unique aspects of nephrologic diagnosis and treatment. Although it is known that elderly patients constitute a group with special needs and present unique challenges to the nephrologist, traditional nephrology fellowship training has not included a focus on the geriatric population. In response to this need for greater education and awareness, the American Society of Nephrology has initiated a program of educational activities in geriatric nephrology and has chartered a specific advisory council. The priority being given to geriatric nephrology is a hopeful sign that issues such as treatment options, the efficacy of treatments, and their effect on quality of life for the elderly patient with kidney disease will be improved in the coming years.",

This method was more sensitive than quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Using DNA template extracted from cultured R. salmoninarum, the LAMP method gave an amplification signal from template diluted to 10(-8) while the limit of detection of qPCR was10(-7). The LAMP method was also highly specific and did not amplify DNA purified from five other Gram-positive and -negative bacterial fish pathogens. The method also worked well using extracts of macrophages infected with R. salmoninarum and kidney material from rainbow trout, which were positive for R. salmoninarum by qPCR and crude R. salmoninarum culture. There was some evidence for inhibitors of the LAMP reaction in the kidney samples, which was overcome by diluting the sample.",

To identify genomic loci that may influence these phenotypes, we assessed recombinant congenic (RC) mice derived from the A/J and C57BL/6J strains for their propensity to develop alveolitis or fibrosis after 18 Gy whole-thorax irradiation. Mouse survival, lung histopathology and bronchoalveolar lavage cell types were recorded. Informative strains for each of mast cell influx, bronchoalveolar cell numbers, alveolitis and fibrosis were identified. In mice with the A/J strain background, the severity of alveolitis correlated with increased mast cell numbers while in C57BL/6J background strain mice fibrosis was correlated with the percentage of neutrophils in lavage. The data for RC mice support the association of specific inflammatory cells with the development of radiation-induced lung disease and provide informative strains with which to dissect the genetic basis of these complex traits.",

In short, posing in displays of power caused advantaged and adaptive psychological, physiological, and behavioral changes, and these findings suggest that embodiment extends beyond mere thinking and feeling, to physiology and subsequent behavioral choices.

Several types of stress were assessed: Chronic interpersonal stress, chronic non-interpersonal stress, episodic dependent (i.e., self-generated) interpersonal stress, episodic dependent non-interpersonal stress, episodic independent interpersonal stress, and episodic independent non-interpersonal stress. Daughters (ages 9-14) were recruited to have no clinically significant symptoms upon entry (T1). By a 30-month follow-up assessment (T2), 45% of the daughters of depressed mothers, but none of the daughters of healthy mothers, had developed a psychiatric disorder. Overall, daughters of depressed mothers were exposed to more severe chronic interpersonal and non-interpersonal stress than were daughters of healthy mothers. Further, daughters of depressed mothers who developed a psychiatric disorder by T2 were exposed to more severe chronic non-interpersonal stress and episodic dependent stress than were daughters of depressed mothers who remained healthy.

We examined three approaches for injection into rat DRGs: percutaneous injection without surgical exposure, injection after deep exposure, and injection following deep exposure and partial laminectomy. Coomassie blue and Fast Blue were injected into DRGs for validation. At necropsy, the spread of Coomassie blue and Fast Blue was investigated under stereomicroscope and fluorescent microscope, respectively. We found that percutaneous approach did not provide any successful DRG injections. Deep exposure prior to intraganglionic injection provided variable results, but intraganglionic injection after deep exposure plus partial laminectomy was successful in 100% of attempts. Our subsequent skeletal analysis showed that the anatomical location of DRG is not compatible with successful DRG injection without surgical exposure. Neither of the methods using surgical exposure caused behavioral disturbances. Based on these results we conclude that partial laminectomy offers the most precise method of injecting DRG and does not produce behavioral evidence of nerve damage. Intraganglionic injection after deep exposure alone is less predictable, while percutaneous approaches only allow injection in the peripheral nerve.",

The following commentaries on the KDIGO guidelines represent the consensus of our work group. The KDIGO transplant guidelines concentrated on aspects of transplant care most important to this population in the posttransplant period, such as immunosuppression, infection, malignancy, and cardiovascular care. Our KDOQI work group concurred with many of the KDIGO recommendations except in some important areas related to immunosuppression, in which decisions in the United States are largely made by transplant centers and are dependent in part on the specific patient population served. Most, but not all, KDIGO guidelines are relevant to US patients. However, implementation of many may remain a major challenge because of issues of limitation in resources needed to assist in the tasks of educating, counseling, and implementing and maintaining lifestyle changes. Although very few of the guidelines are based on evidence that is strong enough to justify their being used as the basis of policy or performance measures, they offer an excellent road map to navigate the complex care of KTRs.",

We hypothesized that cocaine abuse may lead to altered mitochondrial function that in turn may cause left ventricular dysfunction. Seven days of cocaine administration to rats led to an increased oxygen consumption detected in cardiac fibers, specifically through complex I and complex III. ROS levels were increased, specifically in interfibrillar mitochondria. In parallel there was a decrease in ATP synthesis, whereas no difference was observed in subsarcolemmal mitochondria. This uncoupling effect on oxidative phosphorylation was not detectable after short-term exposure to cocaine, suggesting that these mitochondrial abnormalities were a late rather than a primary event in the pathological response to cocaine. MitoQ, a mitochondrial-targeted antioxidant, was shown to completely prevent these mitochondrial abnormalities as well as cardiac dysfunction characterized here by a diastolic dysfunction studied with a conductance catheter to obtain pressure-volume data. Taken together, these results extend previous studies and demonstrate that cocaine-induced cardiac dysfunction may be due to a mitochondrial defect.",

        "medline_abstract_text":"Alcoholic liver disease is mediated via activation of TLR4 signaling; MyD88-dependent and -independent signals are important contributors to injury in mouse models. Adiponectin, an anti-inflammatory adipokine, suppresses TLR4/MyD88-dependent responses via induction of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). Here we investigated the interactions between chronic ethanol, adiponectin, and HO-1 in regulation of TLR4/MyD88-independent signaling in macrophages and an in vivo mouse model. After chronic ethanol feeding, LPS-stimulated expression of IFN-β and CXCL10 mRNA was increased in primary cultures of Kupffer cells compared with pair-fed control mice. Treatment of Kupffer cells with globular adiponectin (gAcrp) normalized this response. LPS-stimulated IFN-β/CXCL10 mRNA and CXCL10 protein was also reduced in RAW 264.7 macrophages treated with gAcrp or full-length adiponectin. gAcrp and full-length adiponectin acted via adiponectin receptors 1 and 2, respectively. gAcrp decreased TLR4 expression in both Kupffer cells and RAW 264.7 macrophages. Small interfering RNA knockdown of HO-1 or inhibition of HO-1 activity with zinc protoporphyrin blocked these effects of gAcrp. C57BL/6 mice were exposed to chronic ethanol feeding, with or without treatment with cobalt protoporphyrin, to induce HO-1. After chronic ethanol feeding, mice were sensitized to in vivo challenge with LPS, expressing increased IFN-β/CXCL10 mRNA and CXCL10 protein in liver compared with control mice. Pretreatment with cobalt protoporphyrin 24 h before LPS challenge normalized this effect of ethanol. Adiponectin and induction of HO-1 potently suppressed TLR4-dependent/MyD88-independent cytokine expression in primary Kupffer cells from rats and in mouse liver after chronic ethanol exposure. These data suggest that induction of HO-1 may be a useful therapeutic strategy in alcoholic liver disease.",

        "medline_abstract_text":"Alcohol-induced liver disease (ALD) is a leading cause of nonaccident-related deaths in the United States. Although liver damage caused by ALD is reversible when discovered at the earlier stages, current risk assessment tools are relatively nonspecific. Identification of an early specific signature of ALD would aid in therapeutic intervention and recovery. In this study, the metabolic changes associated with ALD were examined using alcohol-fed male Ppara-null mouse as a model of ALD. Principal components analysis of the mass spectrometry-based urinary metabolic profile showed that alcohol-treated wild-type and Ppara-null mice could be distinguished from control animals without information on history of alcohol consumption. The urinary excretion of ethyl-sulfate, ethyl-beta-d-glucuronide, 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, and 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid sulfate was elevated and that of the 2-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, adipic acid, and pimelic acid was depleted during alcohol treatment in both wild-type and the Ppara-null mice albeit to different extents. However, indole-3-lactic acid was exclusively elevated by alcohol exposure in Ppara-null mice. The elevation of indole-3-lactic acid is mechanistically related to the molecular events associated with development of ALD in alcohol-treated Ppara-null mice. This study demonstrated the ability of a metabolomics approach to identify early, noninvasive biomarkers of ALD pathogenesis in Ppara-null mouse model.",

This study estimated the prevalence of drug abuse, knowledge about drug abuse and its effect on psychosocial well-being and induced behavioral problems among students of a public rural secondary school that admitted both girls and boys which offered both boarding and day school facilities. The students filled out a self-reporting substance use tool which measures the prevalence, frequency, and general patterns of substance use. Alcohol, tobacco, khat (catha edulis) and bhang (cannabis) were the most commonly reported substance of use, with user prevalence rates of 5.2%, 3.8%, 3.2%, and 1.7%, respectively. Tobacco use was initiated at 10 years, while cannabis, hard drugs, khat, and alcohol were initiated at 11, 12, 13, and 15 years of age, respectively. Among the students 71% were aware that their schoolmates were on drugs and it was known by 49.8%, 41.7%, 37.6%, 44.3%, and 32.4% of these students that using alcohol, tobacco, khat, cannabis, and hard drugs, respectively was a behavioral problem in the school. Three quarters of the students were aware that use of drugs was harmful to their health, with majority (78.6%) indicating that drug users need help to stop the drug use behavior. However most (73.6%) of the students suggested drug users in school should be punished. The drug use behavioral problems included school dropout, poor scholastic attainment, drunken driving, delinquency, and adolescence pregnancy which threaten the stability of the education system, family as an institution (family difficulties) and society at large. Therefore, teachers have an added burden of playing an active role in guidance and counselling the survivors of drug abuse, a pandemic facing teaching institutions apart from instilling knowledge.",

Forty-nine women experiencing intimate partner abuse participated in a health care-based domestic violence (DV) advocacy program for 6 months or more. An analysis of structured interviews in English and Spanish found that the majority of participants perceived positive changes in their personal safety and emotional health because of their involvement in the program. Some participants also perceived improvements in their physical health, unhealthy coping behaviors (e.g., overeating and smoking), and health care following program involvement. Participants' responses suggest a process of change whereby DV advocacy services first contribute to improved safety and emotional health, which then facilitates behavioral changes. Behavioral changes may subsequently contribute to improvements in physical health, which may also benefit emotional health. Longitudinal evaluations are needed to evaluate the impact of DV advocacy and other interventions for partner abuse on women's health and safety over time.",

All groups were subjected to parasitological, histopathological, immunohistochemical and biochemical assays. The results revealed a significant decrease in IL-4 serum level with a significant increase in gamma amino butyric acid (GABA) and decrease in zinc brain levels in GI, while GII showed non significant increase in IL-4 level that resulted in a highly significant increase in the mean number of cysticercoids and adult worms with delayed expulsion as compared to GIII. This was reflected on histopathological and immunohistochemical changes in the brain. Also, there was a highly significant increase in GABA and decrease in zinc brain levels in GII to the degree that induced behavioral changes.

Some evidence has indicated that statins might have therapeutic and preventive benefits for Alzheimer's disease (AD). We and others also have shown the beneficial effect of statin treatment in reversing learning and memory deficits in animal models of AD. However, data from clinical trials are inconclusive. We previously documented that the adenovirus vector encoding 11 tandem repeats of Aβ1-6 fused to the receptor-binding domain (Ia) of Pseudomonas exotoxin A, AdPEDI-(Aβ1-6)(11), is effective in inducing an immune response against amyloid-β protein (Aβ) and reducing brain Aβ load in Alzheimer's mouse models. In the present study, we examined whether the administration of simvastatin can modulate immune and behavioral responses of C57BL/6 mice to vaccination. Simvastatin was given to the animals as a diet admixture for four weeks, followed by nasal vaccination with AdPEDI-(Aβ1-6)(11) once per week for four weeks. The cholesterol-lowering action of simvastatin was monitored by measuring the cholesterol levels in plasma. Simvastatin significantly increased the number of the mice responding to vaccination compared with the mice receiving only AdPEDI-(Aβ1-6)(11). Immunoglobulin isotyping revealed that the vaccination predominantly induced Th2 immune responses. Simvastatin treatment prevented Aβ-induced production of IFN-γ in splenocytes. The adenovirus vaccination altered mouse behavior in T- and elevated plus-maze tests and simvastatin counteracted such behavioral changes. Our results indicate that simvastatin clearly enhances the immune responses of C57BL/6 mice to the nasal vaccination with AdPEDI-(Aβ1-6)(11). Simvastatin may be effective in preventing behavioral changes associated with vaccination.",

With technical advancement and the improvement of perioperative care, liver resections are widely performed and surgical mortality is approaching zero. In the early 1990s, liver transplantation evolved as a feasible option in the treatment of end-stage liver disease in Korea, with successful adult living-donor liver transplantation (LDLT) as one of the greatest achievements. Various innovations in surgical approaches have been introduced. We review the current status of hepatic surgery in liver disease in Korea.",

The aim was to explore the association between experience of sickness absence and self-rated physical health. Interview data from population samples in 1990 and 1995 of women born in 1935, 1945, 1955 and 1965 (n=231) were used. 'Any sick-leave' and 'Long sick-leave' were used as exposure measures and analyzed in relation to change in self-rated physical health with multivariate logistic regression, adjusting for age and prior sickness absence. Separate analyses were performed for women with psychiatric disorders (DSM-III-R) and different level of domestic responsibility. The proportion reporting good health at baseline and follow up were lower when experienced sickness absence compared to those who had not. For women exposed to long sick-leave, the OR for remained poor health were 4.1 (95% CI 1.1-15.4), and for women with psychiatric disorders, the OR for a change from poor to good health was 9.9 (1.7-58.5). Women with high level of domestic responsibility and exposed to long sick-leave, had increased ORs for both a positive and negative change in health.

A significantly increased frequency of TLR4 Asp299Gly mutation was observed in the patient group (17%) as compared with healthy controls [8.8%, chi(2) = 10.7, P = 0.001,odds ratio (OR ) = 2.1]. On the other hand, the TLR4 Thr399Ile mutation occurred with comparable frequencies in the two groups (12.6% among patients and 9% in healthy controls). The PTB patients were categorized on the basis of their bacillary load as 3+, 2+, 1+, negative and on the extent of lung involvement as having minimal, moderate, and far-advanced lung disease. The 299Gly mutant occurred in homozygous state (GG) only in patients with high bacillary load (3+) and those with far-advanced lung disease. Similarly, the mutant 399Ile was significantly pronounced in these patients in the homozygous state (TT).

The present study was carried out to investigate the role of catechin as a chain breaking inhibitor against experimental alcoholic liver injury. Rats were administered 35% v/v ethanol orally at a dose of 10 g/Kg/day for two weeks, followed by 14 g/Kg/day for 10 weeks. Catechin (50 mg/Kg) was co-supplemented after 4 weeks of alcohol treatment till the end of the dosing period. Following chronic alcohol exposure, rats developed endotoxemia and severe pathological changes in the liver such as pronounced fatty change, vacuolar degeneration and inflammation. These changes were accompanied by activation of NF-κB and induction of inflammatory and cytotoxic mediators leading to increased level of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, enhanced formation of malondialdehyde in the liver followed by drastic alterations in the hepatic antioxidant defense systems. Additionally, nitrite levels and lactate dehydrogenase activities were also significantly elevated on chronic alcohol consumption. Alcohol exposure also increased the number of micronucleated cells indicating that alcohol abuse may again be associated with the nuclear changes. Supplementation with catechin ameliorated the alcohol-induced liver injury by downregulating the endotoxin-mediated activation of initial signalling molecule NF-κB and further going downstream the signalling cascade including tumor necrosis factor-alpha, nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species and by enhancing the antioxidant profile. These observations correlated well with the histological findings. Moreover, a remarkable decrease in the percentage of micronucleated cells was observed with catechin supplementation indicating an apparent protection against alcohol-induced toxicity. These findings suggest that catechin may alleviate experimental alcoholic liver disease by suppressing induction of NF-κB, a key component of signalling pathway, thus forming a pharmacological basis for designing novel therapeutic agents against alcohol induced endotoxin-mediated liver injury.",

Calibration of a new PT test system is performed with the appropriate IS and fresh plasma samples of healthy (normal) volunteers and patients treated with VKA. The calibration model is based on the assumption of a linear relationship between the log(PT)'s obtained with the new PT system and the reference IS for both normal and patients' samples. Patients' samples for calibration should be selected by rejecting samples beyond the 1.5-4.5 INR range. Outliers should be rejected defined as points with a perpendicular distance greater than three residual standard deviations from the line of relationship. Selection of patients' samples and rejection of outliers result in a reduction of the between-laboratory variation of calibration.

Data on 107 patients (median age 46.8 years, 72% male) with end-stage liver disease who received OLT were retrospectively analysed. The incidence of PPCs was 60.7%. Overall mortality was 13.1% and pulmonary causes accounted for 85.7% of deaths. Mortality was 18.5% and 4.8% for patients with and without pulmonary complications, respectively. Independent risk factors for PPCs were a preoperative model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score > or =25, intraoperative fluid transfusion volume > 10 1 and intraoperative blood transfusion volume > 4 l. A fluid balance of < or = -300 ml for > or =2 days of the first 3 days after surgery was protective. Other variables studied did not predict PPCs. It was concluded that improving the patient's preoperative medical condition, restricting intraoperative transfusion volumes and maintaining a negative fluid balance in the first 3 days after operation may decrease PPCs.",

The treatment duration was 16 weeks (12 weeks in the hospital and 4 weeks after the discharge). The study revealed that rivastigmine improved cognitive functions and led to the reduction of psychotic and behavioral disorders in AD patients at the moderate stage of the disease. The inclusion of rivastigmine in the complex treatment of AD patients resulted in the significant reduction in doses of necessary psychotropic drugs and in the complete withdrawal of all antipsychotic drugs in some patients. It should be specifically emphasized that the treatment with rivastigmine of patients with moderate AD and behavioral disorders led to the significant (up to 30%) reduction of the time spent for caregiving, the decrease of burden and the health improvement of caregivers that increase quality of life of both the patient and the family.",

Fresh feces from black-tailed jackrabbits (Lepus californicus, n=100), striped skunks (Mephitis mephitis, n=22), feral cats (Felis catus, n=14), Brewer's Blackbirds (Euphagus cyanocephalus, n=10), Virginian opossums (Didelphis virginiana, n=9), raccoons (Procyon lotor, n=4), California ground squirrels (Spermophilus beecheyi, n=3), and coyotes (Canis latrans, n=2) were collected from August 2006 to January 2007 either from the ground while walking the premises or after trapping the animals using live traps. Nucleic acid purified from feces was directly processed for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis using a real-time PCR assay targeting the aspartate ammonia lyase gene of L. intracellularis. Purified DNA samples were also precipitated, preamplified for L. intracellularis, and analyzed using the same real-time PCR assay, to increase the detection limit to one L. intracellularis organism per extracted sample. Feces from jackrabbits, striped skunks, Virginian opossums, and coyotes tested PCR positive for L. intracellularis, whereas all feces from feral cats, Brewer's Blackbirds, raccoons, and ground squirrels tested PCR negative for L. intracellularis. PCR testing on DNA extracted directly from feces was positive for L. intracellularis in six of 164 fecal samples. When DNA purification from feces was followed by a precipitation and preamplification step, five additional fecal samples tested PCR positive for L. intracellularis (11/164). The largest number of PCR positive L. intracellularis fecal samples was observed in striped skunks, followed by Virginian opossums, jackrabbits, and coyotes. This is the first description of L. intracellularis in these four species. Because the fecal samples were collected at equine farms with confirmed cases of EPE, striped skunks, Virginian opossums, jackrabbits, and coyotes may act as potential sources of infection to susceptible weanlings.",

        "medline_abstract_text":"In the peacock blenny Salaria pavo large males with well-developed secondary sexual characters establish nests and attract females while small \"sneaker\" males mimic female sexual displays in order to approach the nests of larger males and parasitically fertilize eggs. These alternative reproductive tactics are sequential, as sneakers irreversibly switch into nesting males. This transition involves major morphologic and behavioral changes and is likely to be mediated by hormones. This study focuses on the role of aromatase, an enzyme that catalyses the conversion of androgens into estrogens, in the regulation of male sexual polymorphism in S. pavo. For this, sex steroid plasma levels and aromatase activity (AA) in gonads, whole brain and brain macroareas were determined in sneakers, transitional males (i.e. sneakers undergoing the transition into nesting males), nesting males and females collected in the field. AA was much higher in ovarian tissue than in testicular tissue and accordingly circulating estradiol levels were highest in females. This supports the view that elevated AA and estradiol levels are associated with the development of a functional ovary. Transitional males are in a non-reproductive phase and had underdeveloped testes when compared with sneakers and nesting males. Testicular AA was approximately 10 times higher in transitional males when compared with sneakers and nesting males, suggesting high AA has a suppressive effect on testicular development. Nesting males had significantly higher plasma levels of both testosterone (T) and 11-ketotestosterone when compared with the other male morphs and previous studies demonstrated that these androgens suppress female-like displays in sneakers. In the brain, AA was highest in macroareas presumably containing hypothalamic nuclei traditionally associated with the regulation of reproductive behaviors. Overall, females presented the highest levels of brain AA. In male morphs AA increased from sneakers, to transitional males, to nesting males in all brain macroareas. These results suggest that the transition into the nesting male tactic is accompanied both by an increase in testicular androgen production and by a higher conversion of androgens into estrogens in the brain. The increase in androgen production is likely to mediate the development of male secondary sexual characters while the increase in brain AA may be related to the behavioral changes associated with tactic transition.",

Experiment 1 was conducted to group cysts into 4 patterns based on alteration of plasma progesterone (P(4)) concentrations on d -7 and d 0 (=CIDR insertion) with 1.0 ng/ml as the cut-off level by ultrasonographic examination of 28 cows with COD that were >or=40 days postpartum and anoestrous after calving. In Experiment 2, a total of 55 cows under the same conditions as in Experiment 1 were utilized, and the same regimen as in Experiment 1 was performed without 7 days of pre-observation before treatment. As a result, 92.9% of CLs on d 21 were highly formed in Experiment 1 and 83.6% were highly formed in Experiment 2. The conception rates within 60 days after CIDR removal were also satisfactory high and were 71.4% and 54.5%, respectively. There were no differences in any overall reproductive parameters between Experiments 1 and 2 (P>0.05). The average days between CIDR removal and conception were 24.4 +/- 5.3 and 24.0 +/- 6.5 days, respectively (P>0.05); therefore, the conception dates of the cows in Experiment 2 were at least 7 days earlier compared with Experiment 1. In conclusion, treatment with a CIDR and PGF(2alpha) against COD could minimize the risk of incorrect treatment and provide sufficient reproductive performance in Japanese Black cows.",

        "medline_abstract_text":"The L-arginine/nitric oxide (L-Arg/NO) pathway is altered in liver and kidney diseases. However, the status of the L-Arg/NO pathway during and after orthotopic transplantation is insufficiently investigated and findings are uncertain because of analytical shortcomings. Also, most human studies have focused on individual members of the L-Arg/NO pathway such as nitrate or asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA). In the present article we report on a pilot study investigating extensively the status of the L-Arg/NO pathway before and during orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). By using fully validated, highly sensitive and specific GC-MS and GC-MS/MS methods nitrite, nitrate, ADMA and its hydrolysis product dimethylamine (DMA), L-arginine and L-ornithine were measured in blood and urine. Our study gives strong evidence of the exceptional importance of hepatic dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH) activity for the elimination of systemic ADMA. In end-stage liver disease the synthesis of NO and ADMA as well as the DDAH activity are elevated. However, increase in DDAH activity is insufficient to efficiently eliminate overproduced ADMA. The transplanted liver graft is capable of clearing ADMA in a rapid and sufficient manner. In contrast to studies from other groups, our study shows that in OLT as well as in living donor kidney transplantation, the second study reported here, reperfusion of the graft does not cause drastic alterations to the L-Arg/NO pathway with regard to NO synthesis. In the OLT study the concentration of circulating L-arginine fell temporally dramatically, while L-ornithine levels increased diametrically, most likely due to elevation of arginase activity. However, the relatively long-lasting decrease in plasmatic L-arginine in OLT seems not to have affected NO synthesis after reperfusion. Our OLT study suggests that liver reperfusion is associated with greatly elevated activity of proteolytic and hydrolytic enzymes including DDAH and arginase. Suppression of proteolytic and hydrolytic activity in transplantation could be a useful measure to improve outcome and remains to be investigated in further studies on larger patient collectives. The importance of analytical chemistry in this area of research is also discussed in this article.",

SIRT3 is an antiaging molecule regulated by calorie restriction and mitochondria-localized NAD(+)-dependent deacetylase. In this study, we investigated whether SIRT3 reversed renal lipotoxicity-mediated ROS and inflammation. In the kidney of the FFA-bound BSA-overloaded mouse, which is a well-established experimental model of FFA-associated tubulointerstitial inflammation, mRNA expression of SIRT3 was significantly decreased and negatively correlated with mRNA expression of an inflammatory cytokine, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1). In cultured proximal tubular (mProx) cells, the saturated FFA palmitate stimulated ROS accumulation and expression of MCP-1. These effects were ameliorated by retrovirus-mediated overexpression of SIRT3, whereas they were exacerbated by either overexpression of a dominant-negative form of SIRT3(N87A) lacking deacetylase activity or knockdown of SIRT3 by siRNA transfection. Furthermore, we showed that SIRT3 positively regulated both mitochondrial oxidative capacity and antioxidant gene expression, thereby reducing ROS accumulation in mProx cells, which suggests a mechanism that underlies SIRT3-mediated reversal of palmitate-induced inflammation. In conclusion, these results highlight a new role for SIRT3 in lipotoxicity/ROS-related inflammation, reveal a new molecular mechanism underlying calorie restriction-mediated antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, and could aid in the design of new therapies for the prevention of tubulointerstitial lesions in proteinuric kidney disease.",

A screening tool was developed based on reported best practices to screen all community members over the age of 19 years for CKD. A unique, highly efficacious project algorithm and an electronic database were created to ensure appropriate, seamless patient care and management in this complex, multi-stakeholder environment based on client risk and CKD stage. Over the course of nine months, the project succeeded in screening 83% of all community members over the age of 19 years; 30% of clients were found to have CKD stage two or greater. A strong correlation was found between diabetes and CKD in project participants. A significant number of clients were referred for specialist care. Critical to the success of this project was the effort made to develop collaborative partnerships among five stakeholder groups: the First Nations communities, the LHIN, PRHC, local family physicians and specialist physicians.",

One approach is drug-challenge pharmaco-magnetic resonance imaging (phMRI). We have previously shown that intravenous administration of the 5-HT(2C) agonist m-chlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP) elicits increases in blood oxygenation dependent signal (BOLD) in regions consistent with the distribution of 5-HT(2C) receptors. In the current study we determined whether BOLD signal responses to mCPP could be blocked by pre-treatment with a 5-HT(2C) antagonist. Healthy male volunteers received oral mirtazapine, 5-HT(2)/5-HT(3) receptor antagonist, or placebo 90min prior to intravenous mCPP challenge phMRI. BOLD signal increases following mCPP infusion occurred in areas known to be rich in 5-HT(2C) receptors such as the substantia nigra, hypothalamus, pallidum and amygdala. These responses were attenuated by mirtazapine pre-treatment. The results suggest that mCPP-challenge phMRI produces reliable patterns of response that are mediated by 5-HT(2C) receptors; these responses may therefore be useful in-vivo measures of 5-HT(2C) function in psychiatric disorders.",

Physicians pay attention to the differential diagnosis of the disease caused by MAC from tuberculosis because of their similar clinical presentations. Expression of the macrophage-induced gene (mig) is one of the virulence phenotypes in MAC, but it has not been determined whether the presence of the mig gene itself has any relationship with clinical disease or whether it is merely a marker for MAC. To uncover the significance of the mig gene among MAC clinical isolates, positive cultures from respiratory specimens from patients in a tertiary referral centre were identified by sequencing the 16S rRNA gene. The mig gene was also evaluated using PCR and sequence analysis. The medical records from the patients were reviewed retrospectively. The diagnostic criteria from the American Thoracic Association were adopted for the diagnosis of NTM lung disease. A total of 45 MAC clinical isolates were identified over a period of 1 year. Following 16S rRNA sequencing, all of the 23 M. avium isolates were categorized as sequevar I. Among the 22 Mycobacterium intracellulare isolates, 18 strains were identified as M. intracellulare sequevar I and the remaining four consisted of one each of sequevars II, III, IV and V. The proportion of cases that fitted the diagnostic criteria of NTM lung disease was 26.7 % (12/45). The mig PCR results were 100 % positive for the MAC isolates studied, irrespective of their species, sequevar or disease-causing properties. However, following bootstrap analysis of the mig sequences, we observed definite grouping between M. avium and M. intracellulare. Thus the mig gene is a species-specific marker with distinct sequence diversity between the two species M. avium and M. intracellulare, but there is poor correlation between disease-causing properties and specific mig sequences.",

Such a view is provided by a systems biology approach, whereby the many layers of complexity, from the molecular genetic, to the cellular, to the tissue, to the whole organ, and finally to the whole body, are synthesized into a working model of understanding. The systems biology approach therefore relies on the expertise of many disciplines, including genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, physiomics, and, ultimately, clinical medicine. The overall structure and functioning of the lung cannot be predicted from studying any one of these systems in isolation, and so this approach highlights the importance of emergence as the fundamental feature of systems biology. In this paper, we will provide an overview of a systems biology approach to lung disease by briefly reviewing the advances made at many of these levels, with special emphasis on recent work done in the realm of pulmonary physiology and the analysis of clinical phenotypes.",

This study aims to report on progress and challenges of haemophilia care in SA after implementation of the NHP. Haemophilia care data collected by MASAC from all treatment centres (HTCs) from 2004 to 2007 were reviewed and appraised. Data assessment included evaluation of the number and types of professional haemophilia expertise, diagnostic and human resources available, number and types of HTCs, number and types of haemophilia diagnoses, immunological complications of haemophilia, social, medical and surgical interventions, factor usage and reporting on haemophilia mortality. Over 2200 bleeding diathesis patients in SA were cared for by an average of 79 professionals in 17 HTCs. Fifty-nine per cent were haemophilia A, 21% von Willebrand's disease, 12% haemophilia B and the remainder had rare bleeding diathesis and thrombocytopathies. In 2004-2007, the number of haemophilia professionals stayed the same, clinic visits increased, new patients and inhibitor patients also increased. Surgical and medical interventions were unchanged and per capita factor usage increased from 0.65 to 0.95. National mortality rate remained below 10 deaths per year. Haemophilia care in SA is highly organized and effective in the delivery of haemophilia health services. All diagnosed uncomplicated haemophiliacs have access to state funded factor concentrate.

After liver transplantation we have to pay attention to the further loss of function because of applied calcineurin inhibitor treatment. It has nephrotoxic side-effect, so the investigation of renal function is converted into an important mission in liver transplant patients. In our study we compared the results between formulas which use serum creatinine: MDRD, which use albumin, too, has effectively other values than the Cockroft-Gault. We compared the two formulas in a retrospective analysis, in 187 patients at a stated time (before operation, after operation, within 1 week, 1 month). We got higher GFR at each date with Cockroft-Gault; mean differences: 19.56%, 17.33%, 37.18% and 28.8%. In the range of 15-60 ml/min GFR, we found nearly twice as many patients by use of MDRD than by use of Cockroft-Gault. Median with MDRD: 79 ml/min, 65.1 ml/min, 52 ml/min, 49.5 ml/min; median with Cockroft-Gault: 93.8 ml/min, 78 ml/min, 70.1 ml/min, 69.4 ml/min, all are significant ( p < 0.001). Many previous studies have already compared the two formulas in end stage kidney disease. On the basis of these studies, MDRD is suitable also under 30 ml/min GFR, but Cockroft-Gault formula approached real GFR measured with isotope methods only above this value. We got the similar conclusion in the examined patient group. It can be stated that MDRD is more suitable to determine renal function in liver transplant patients.",

The objective of this study was to explore the role which life events' experience, in particular drug-related events such as detoxification or withdrawal symptoms, may play on the risk of death in HIV-infected IDUs. Our analysis was based on longitudinal data of 296 HIV-infected IDUs from when they started HAART. Data collection included medical records and patient's self-reports detailing, among other information, life events including drug-related problems. Multiple imputations for missing data in the explanatory variables together with Cox models were used to identify predictors of death. During HAART follow-up, 26 deaths occurred, corresponding to 1.8 deaths per 100 person-years. The majority (N=8) were attributable to liver disease while 5 were from unknown causes (found deceased at home or in a car). After adjustment for age and time-dependent viral load (>10,000 cp/ml) individuals experiencing withdrawal symptoms had a fivefold increased risk of death with respect to the others. Withdrawal symptoms in IDUs living with HIV reflect physicians' difficulties in managing their patients' opioid dependence. Early detection and increasing substitution dosages or switching to a more adequate treatment could prevent possible drug-related deaths.",

        "medline_abstract_text":"Drugs of abuse acquire different degrees of control over thoughts and actions based not only on the effects of drugs themselves, but also on predispositions of the individual. Those individuals who become addicted are unable to shift their thoughts and actions away from drugs and drug-associated stimuli. Thus in addicts, exposure to places or things (cues) that has been previously associated with drug-taking often instigates renewed drug-taking. We and others have postulated that drug-associated cues acquire the ability to maintain and instigate drug-taking behavior in part because they acquire incentive motivational properties through Pavlovian (stimulus-stimulus) learning. In the case of compulsive behavioral disorders, including addiction, such cues may be attributed with pathological incentive value (\"incentive salience\"). For this reason, we have recently begun to explore individual differences in the tendency to attribute incentive salience to cues that predict rewards. When discrete cues are associated with the non-contingent delivery of food or drug rewards some animals come to quickly approach and engage the cue even if it is located at a distance from where the reward will be delivered. In these animals the reward-predictive cue itself becomes attractive, eliciting approach towards it, presumably because it is attributed with incentive salience. Animals that develop this type of conditional response are called \"sign-trackers\". Other animals, \"goal-trackers\", do not approach the reward-predictive cue, but upon cue presentation they immediately go to the location where food will be delivered (the \"goal\"). For goal-trackers the reward-predictive cue is not attractive, presumably because it is not attributed with incentive salience. We review here preliminary data suggesting that these individual differences in the tendency to attribute incentive salience to cues predictive of reward may confer vulnerability or resistance to compulsive behavioral disorders, including addiction. It will be important, therefore, to study how environmental, neurobiological and genetic interactions determine the extent to which individuals attribute incentive value to reward-predictive stimuli.",

        "medline_abstract_text":"On the basis of the growing evidence from randomized trials that routine prophylactic drainage is unnecessary in liver surgery or even harmful in chronic liver disease, we challenged the concept of prophylactic drainage in orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). Since September 2006, we omitted drains in every patient who underwent OLT, regardless of the procedure. Thirty-five cadaveric OLTs were performed during a 12-month period. These patients were matched 1:2 with 70 patients who had prophylactic drainage after OLT according to donor/recipient age, recipient gender, recipient body mass index, and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score. Endpoints were postoperative morbidity, in-hospital mortality, intensive care unit (ICU), and hospital stay. Complications were graded according to a therapy-oriented classification (grades I-V). Both groups (no drainage, n = 35; drainage, n = 70) were comparable in terms of median donor age (47.5 versus 51.0 years), recipient age (50.6 versus 52.0 years), MELD score (18 versus 14), and body mass index (25.3 versus 26 kg/m(2)). Because of the increasing shortage of organs, more marginal grafts were used in the recent period (ie, no-drainage group): 49% (17/35) versus 27% (19/70; P = 0.04). Major complications were not different between groups: grade 3a (endoscopic/radiological intervention) in 20% (7/35) versus 16% (11/70; not significant), grade 3b (surgical intervention) in 23% (8/35) versus 17% (12/70; not significant), grade 4a (ICU therapy, intermittent hemodialysis) in 34% (12/35) versus 21% (15/70; not significant), grade 4b (multiorgan failure) in 14% (5/35) versus 10% (7/70; not significant), and grade 5 (death) in 6% (2/35) versus 7% (5/70; not significant). This matched case study challenges the dogma of prophylactic drainage after OLT. A no-drain strategy provided no disadvantages despite increased use of extended criteria donors in the no-drainage group. Prophylactic drainage appears unnecessary on a routine basis.",

Over the past 20 years, the advent of mutant and transgenic mice and the manipulation of gene expression in other animal models has resulted in major advances in identification of the cellular and molecular mechanisms that direct kidney morphogenesis, providing insights into the pathophysiology of renal and urologic anomalies. This review focuses on the molecular mechanisms that define kidney progenitor cell populations, induce nephron formation within the metanephric mesenchyme, initiate and organize ureteric bud branching, and participate in terminal differentiation of the nephron. Highlighted are common signaling pathways that function at multiple stages during kidney development, including signaling via Wnts, bone morphogenic proteins, fibroblast growth factor, sonic hedgehog, RET/glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor, and notch pathways. Also emphasized are the roles of transcription factors Odd1, Eya1, Pax2, Lim1, and WT-1 in directing renal development. Areas requiring future investigation include the factors that modulate signaling pathways to provide temporal and site-specific effects. The evolution of our understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms of kidney development may provide methods for improved diagnosis of renal anomalies and, hopefully, targets for intervention for this common cause of childhood end-stage kidney disease.",

Two cannabinoid (CB) receptors (CB1 and CB2) currently represent prime endocannabinoid-system therapeutic targets for ligands that either mimic endocannabinoid signalling processes and/or potentiate endocannabinoid-system activity (agonists) or attenuate pathologically heightened endocannabinoid-system transmission (antagonists). Two endocannabinoid deactivating enzymes, fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) and soluble monoacylglycerol lipase (MGL), are increasingly prominent targets for inhibitors that indirectly potentiate endocannabinoid-system signalling. Continued profiling of drug candidates in relevant disease models, identification of additional cannabinoid-related therapeutic targets, and validation of new pharmacological modes of endocannabinoid system modulation will undoubtedly invite further translational efforts in the cannabinoid field for treating psychiatric disorders and other medical conditions.",

        "medline_abstract_text":"Pulmonary inflammation is associated with the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia in premature infants. We have previously shown that perinatal pulmonary expression of human IL-1beta is sufficient to cause a lung disease similar to bronchopulmonary dysplasia, characterized by inflammation, impaired alveolarization, poor postnatal growth, and increased mortality in infant mice. The alphavbeta6 integrin plays a critical role in regulating inflammation in the adult lung. To study the role of the beta6 integrin subunit in neonatal inflammatory lung disease, we compared the pulmonary development in IL-1beta-expressing infant mice with wild-type or null beta6 integrin loci. Absence of the beta6 integrin subunit decreased the mortality and improved the postnatal growth of IL-1beta-expressing pups. The disrupted alveolar development of IL-1beta-expressing mice was improved by beta6 integrin deficiency. IL-1beta-expressing beta6(-/-) pups had shorter alveolar chord length and thinner alveolar walls than IL-1beta-expressing beta6(+/+) pups. In addition, the absence of the beta6 integrin subunit reduced IL-1beta-induced neutrophil and macrophage infiltration into the alveolar spaces. beta6 integrin subunit deficiency suppressed inflammation and goblet cell hyperplasia in the airways and alleviated airway remodeling in IL-1beta-expressing mice. The expression of the chemoattractant proteins, keratinocyte-derived chemokine, macrophage-inflammatory protein-2, calgranulin A, and calgranulin B, of osteopontin, and of the chitinase-like lectins, Ym1 and Ym2, was lower in IL-1beta-expressing beta6(-/-) than in IL-1beta-expressing beta6(+/+) mice. We conclude that absence of the beta6 integrin subunit protects the infant murine lung against IL-1beta-induced inflammation and injury.",

A total of 6000 uniquely identified Atlantic salmon S1 presmolts were randomly assigned to vaccine groups in the hatchery and transferred to a commercial marine aquaculture site. Repeated sampling events to evaluate growth, inherent physical conditions and health status were carried out over the entire production cycle. During the second summer at sea, the study cage developed an outbreak of BKD that lasted approximately 240 days. The effectiveness of the selected vaccines was evaluated using survival analysis methods. The sole vaccine group offering protection for BKD was found to significantly decrease the hazard of dying (hazard ratio, HR = 0.68, P = 0.018) during the outbreak, compared to the industry standard, vaccine group. Additionally, during the outbreak, fish with a shortened operculum had a significantly decreased hazard (HR = 0.38, P = 0.033) compared to those fish with a normal operculum, while fish with jaw deformities had a significantly increased hazard (HR = 2.55, P = 0.001) compared to fish with normal jaw status.",

This process results from synthesis of ECM components and their degradation, mostly by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). However, because of both the multiplicity of their targets that include non-matrix substrates, and the complexity of their regulation, MMPs may exert different, and even opposite, effects during the different phases of the evolution of kidney diseases. The major challenge with future therapeutic interventions will be to accomplish temporal control of MMP activity. In addition to MMPs, enzymes that stabilize ECM (transglutaminase) and cell receptors for ECM components including integrins and discoidin domain receptor-1 (DDR1), play an important role in the cell response to matrix remodeling. Novel therapeutic approaches aimed at targeting transglutaminase and ECM receptors, particularly DDR1, are a promising option provided that specific and safe pharmacological inhibitors be developed. These therapies together with pharmacological agents controlling MMP activity, given in appropriate windows of the course of kidney diseases may represent a useful adjunct to blockers of the renin-angiotensin system.",

        "medline_abstract_text":"Tear lipocalin (TL) (approximately 18 kDa), a member of the lipocalin superfamily, has been identified as one of the major proteins present in rabbit lacrimal fluid. The concentration of TL has been found to be decreased in the tears of patients with dry eye disease. Lacrimal gland insufficiency, one of the major causes of dry eye disease, is known to affect mainly postmenopausal women, where there is a significant decrease in the production of androgen and estrogen. These observations suggest that sex hormones might influence dry eye indirectly by regulating the expression of TL. The purpose of this study was to determine: (1) the effect of sexual maturation on the expression of TL; and (2) if the expression of TL is regulated by the estrogen, 17beta-estradiol, and/or the androgen, dihydrotestosterone, in sexually mature female rabbits. Lacrimal fluid (LF) and lacrimal gland soluble fraction (Si) was collected from juvenile (2 kg) and sexually mature (4 kg) male and female New Zealand white (NZW) rabbits. In addition, LF and Si were collected from 4 kg rabbits, 7 days after being either sham operated (control), ovariectomized (OVX), ovariectomized treated with estrogen (OVX+E) or ovariectomized treated with dihydrotestosterone (OVX+DHT). Samples were analyzed for protein levels of TL by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using a polyclonal rat anti-rabbit TL antibody. Densitometry analysis showed that TL protein levels in both LF and Si increased with age in male and female rabbits. In addition, TL protein levels were significantly higher in the sexually mature 4 kg male compared with the 4 kg female, while no significant difference in TL protein levels were seen among the juvenile male and female rabbits. Furthermore, ovariectomy decreased the protein levels of TL in LF and Si fraction by 50% and 20% respectively, compared with control values. Estrogen treatment increased TL protein levels by 30% and 50% in the LF and Si fraction respectively, compared with the sham operated group. DHT treatment also increased TL protein levels by approximately 150% in both LF and Si fraction compared with control values. These results support the hypothesis that sex hormones influence TL protein levels in rabbit lacrimal glands. The possibility of a role of TL in dry eye needs to be further investigated.",

We examine whether literacy varies by psychiatric diagnoses. Interviews and chart reviews (N = 100) were conducted in a behavioral health outpatient clinic. The relationships among sociodemographics, rapid estimate of adult literacy in medicine, measures of verbal and visual intellectual abilities, and psychiatric diagnoses were examined. The mean rapid estimate of adult literacy in medicine score was 55.9 which is equivalent to below an eighth grade literacy level. Psychotic disorder (p = 0.03) was associated with limited literacy, and substance abuse (p = 0.003) and PTSD (p = 0.07) were associated with higher literacy in bivariate analyses. These diagnoses were further examined in multivariate models. Limitations include the small sample size and the over-representation of people with high levels of education. Increasing our understanding of the relationships between health literacy and psychiatric disorders will help inform the development of appropriate psychiatric care and better outcomes.",

        "medline_abstract_text":"The serotonin transporter (5-HTT) is a protein that has a major role in divergent psychiatric disorders, personality traits and behaviors, by regulating serotonergic synaptic function. Transcriptional activity of the 5-HTT gene (5-HTT or SLC6A4) is modulated by a polymorphic repetitive element (5-HTT gene-linked polymorphic region, 5-HTTLPR), which consists of a 44-base pairs insertion-deletion in the promoter region, creating a short (S) allele and a long (L) allele. Ethnic differences in the allele frequencies of the 5-HTTLPR exist between Caucasian and Asian populations. This study investigated ethnic differences in 5-HTTLPR in 1804 healthy Caucasian subjects from several European populations living in Croatia and the Russian Federation. The genotype and allele frequency of the 5-HTTLPR differed significantly (P<0.001) between male and female Croats, Russians, Tatars and Bashkirs, due to the lower frequency of the S allele (38% and 37%) and S/S genotype (14% and 15%) in Croat men and women compared to other studied groups. When male and female data were collapsed, Russians had marginally different allele and genotype distribution compared to Bashkirs and Tatars. Bashkirs and Tatars had similar allele and genotype frequency. The higher frequency of the S/S genotype was found in Tatars and Bashkirs compared to Croats and Russians. Gender related differences occurred only in the allele distribution within Bashkir population. These ethnic differences might be responsible for the inconsistent findings in the studies of the association between various psychiatric disorders, personality traits, behaviors and 5-HTTLPR across different ethnicities, and should be controlled to enable the generalization of results across various population groups.",

Oxidative stress plays an important role in pathogenesis of ALD and also leads to iron-metabolic disorders. In this study, the effects of vitamin C (Vc) on iron metabolism-related genes expression and liver protection from drinking in mice were investigated. Twenty-four male kunming mice were divided into four groups (six mice per group): control (water drinking); alcohol group (20% alcohol drinking), alcohol + low Vc group (adding 50 mg/kg Vc daily) and alcohol + high Vc group (adding 100 mg/kg Vc daily). All these mice were sacrificed after 7 days. Vc can ameliorate the increase of sera alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity and hepatic iron overload of drinking alcohol in mice. Vc increases the expression of the iron-regulated hormone hepcidin and decreases transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) expression in liver. Vc also down-regulates the expression of ferroportin 1 (Fpn1) in the intestine and decreases the iron release to blood. In conclusion, Vc ameliorated the alcoholic liver injuries through regulating the iron metabolism-related genes expression.",

Within this process, a pathogenic element might be the endothelial dysfunction induced by the combined effect of several factors such as: cigarette smoke, inflammatory mediators, hypoxia, mechanical stress, whose contribution differs according to the stage of the disease. The aims of our study were to characterize the structural pulmonary vascular abnormalities present in smokers and patients with mild COPD and to assess their pathophysiological importance. Serial tissue sections from fragments of pulmonary exeresis have been subjected to both morphometric analysis and histochemical examination of muscular pulmonary arteries. Our results have shown a process of arteriolar muscularization and intimal thickening of small muscular arteries in both smokers (intimal index 23.11% +/- 3.04%) and patients with mild COPD (25.62% +/- 3.06%) as compared to controls (17.86% +/- 2.96%). Correlation analysis has demonstrated that intimal thickening is significantly associated with cigarette consumption expressed as packs-years (r = 0.65, p = 0.04) whereas univariate regression has shown a moderate causal relation between the intimal collagen deposits and the degree of vascular thickening (r2=0,53 and p=0,002).

In this review, we focus our description of this phenomenon on inherited disorders affecting the liver, with a particular emphasis on Wilson disease (WD), genetic hemochromatosis, and α-1 anti-trypsin disease (A1-AT). Wide variations in the clinical phenotype of WD may in part be related to the mutations of the ATP7B genotype, though modifier genes and environmental factors also likely play an important role. There is also a significant variability in the expression of iron overload in patients with genetic hemochromatosis that are homozygous for the C282Y mutation.

Autophagy is normally activated in response to nutrient deprivation and other stresses as a cell survival mechanism. Accumulating evidence indicates that autophagy plays a critical role in liver pathophysiology, in addition to maintaining hepatic energy and nutrient balance. Alcohol consumption causes hepatic metabolic changes, oxidative stress, accumulation of lipid droplets and damaged mitochondria; all of these can be regulated by autophagy. This review summarizes the recent findings about the role and mechanisms of autophagy in alcoholic liver disease (ALD), and the possible intervention for treating ALD by modulating autophagy.",

Converging evidence also suggests that serotonergic dysregulation may contribute to behavioral symptoms that frequently occur in AD. This study aimed to define regional reductions in 5-HT(2A) binding in AD patients and to examine their behavioral correlates. Nine patients with probable AD and eight elderly controls were studied using a constant infusion paradigm for equilibrium modeling of [(18)F]deuteroaltanserin with positron emission tomography (PET). Region of interest analyses were performed on PET images coregistered to MRI scans. The outcome measures BP(P) (ratio of specific brain uptake to total plasma parent concentration) and BP(ND) (ratio of specific to nondisplaceable uptake) were obtained for pertinent cortical and subcortical regions. AD patients showed a statistically significant decrease in the anterior cingulate in both BP(P) and BP(ND), but in no other region. Within the AD patient sample, no significant correlations were observed between regional 5-HT(2A) binding and behavioral measures, including depressive and psychotic symptoms. These results confirm a reduction in cortical 5-HT(2A) receptors in AD, specifically in the anterior cingulate. However, in a limited AD patient sample, they fail to demonstrate a relationship between regional 5-HT(2A) binding and major behavioral symptoms.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the probiotic effect of Lactobacillus casei strain Shirota (LcS) on indomethacin-induced small intestinal injury. Rats pretreated with viable LcS or heat-killed LcS once or once daily for a week were administered indomethacin by gavage to induce injury. Anti-inflammatory effects of L-lactic acid (1-15 mM) were evaluated in vitro by use of THP-1 cells. One-week treatment with viable LcS prevented indomethacin-induced intestinal injury with increase in the concentration of lactic acid in small intestinal content and inhibited increases in myeloperoxidase activity and expression of mRNA for tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) while affecting neither TLR4 expression nor the number of gram-negative bacteria in intestinal content, whereas neither heat-killed LcS nor a single dose of viable LcS inhibited intestinal injury. Prevention of this injury was also observed in rats given l-lactic acid in drinking water. Both L-lactic acid and LcS culture supernatant containing 10 mM lactic acid inhibited NF-kappaB activation and increases in TNF-alpha mRNA expression and TNF-alpha protein secretion in THP-1 cells treated with LPS. Western blot analyses showed that both L-lactic acid and LcS culture supernatants suppressed phosphorylation and degradation of I-kappaB-alpha induced by LPS without affecting expression of TLR4. These findings suggest that LcS exhibits a prophylactic effect on indomethacin-induced enteropathy by suppressing the LPS/TLR4 signaling pathway and that this probiotic effect of LcS may be mediated by L-lactic acid.",

        "medline_abstract_text":"Time is a dimension tightly associated with the biology of living species. There are cycles of varied lengths in biological activities, from very short (ultradian) rhythms to rhythms with a period of approximately one day (circadian) and rhythms with longer cycles, of a week, a month, a season, or even longer. These rhythms are generated by endogenous biological clocks, i.e. time-keeping structures, rather than being passive reactions to external fluctuations. In mammals, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is the major pacemaker. The pineal gland, which secretes melatonin, is the major pacemaker in other phyla. There also exist biological clocks generating circadian rhythms in peripheral tissues, for example the liver. A series of clock genes generates the rhythm through positive and negative feedback effect of proteins on their own synthesis, and this system oscillates with a circadian period. External factors serve as indicators of the astronomical (solar) time and are called zeitgebers, literally time-givers. Light is the major zeitgeber, which resets daily the SCN circadian clock. In the absence of zeitgebers, the circadian rhythm is said to be free running; it has a period that differs from 24 hours. The SCN, together with peripheral clocks, enables a time-related homeostasis, which can become disorganized in its regulation by external factors (light, social activities, food intake), in the coordination and relative phase position of rhythms, or in other ways. Disturbances of rhythms are found in everyday life (jet lag, shift work), in sleep disorders, and in several psychiatric disorders including affective disorders. As almost all physiological and behavioural functions in humans occur on a rhythmic basis, the possibility that advances, delays or desynchronization of circadian rhythms might participate in neurological and psychiatric disorders has been a theme of research. In affective disorders, a decreased circadian amplitude of several rhythms as well as a phase advance or delay have been described, leading to hypotheses about changes in biological clocks themselves or in their sensitivity to environmental factors, such as light or social cues. Molecular genetics studies have suggested the involvement of circadian clock genes, but no tight association has yet been found. Agomelatine is an antidepressant, agonist at melatonergic MT(1), MT(2) receptors and antagonist at 5-HT(2C) receptors, and is able to phase advance circadian rhythms in humans. The fact that non-pharmacological (light therapy, sleep deprivation, rhythm therapy) and pharmacological (lithium, antidepressants, agomelatine) therapies of affective disorders influence circadian rhythms indicates that biological clocks play a role in the pathophysiology of these disorders.",

So far, little is known about the effects of psychotropic medications on brain metabolism in either humans or animals. In this study, we investigated the effects of a range of psychotropic drugs on rat brain metabolites. The drugs investigated were haloperidol, clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone, aripiprazole (antipsychotics); valproate, carbamazapine (mood stabilizers) and phenytoin (antiepileptic drug). The relative concentrations of endogenous metabolites were determined using high-resolution proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectroscopy. The results revealed that different classes of psychotropic drugs modulated a range of metabolites, where each drug induced a distinct neurometabolic profile. Some common responses across several drugs or within a class of drug were also observed. Antipsychotic drugs and mood stabilizers, with the exception of olanzapine, consistently increased N-acetylaspartate (NAA) levels in at least one brain area, suggesting a common therapeutic response on increased neuronal viability. Most drugs also altered the levels of several metabolites associated with glucose metabolism, neurotransmission (including glutamate and aspartate) and inositols. The heterogenic pharmacological response reflects the functional and physiological diversity of the therapeutic interventions, including side effects. Further study of these metabolites in preclinical models should facilitate the development of novel drug treatments for psychiatric disorders with improved efficacy and side effect profiles.",

Whereas previously drug-specific pathways leading to initial injury of liver cells were the main focus of mechanistic research and classifications, current concepts see these as initial upstream events and appreciate that subsequent common downstream pathways and their attenuation by drugs and other environmental and genetic factors also have a profound impact on the risk of an individual patient to develop overt liver disease. This review summarizes current mechanistic concepts of DILI in a 3-step model that limits its principle mechanisms to three main ways of initial injury, i.e. direct cell stress, direct mitochondrial impairment, and specific immune reactions. Subsequently, initial injury initiates further downstream events, i.e. direct and death receptor-mediated pathways leading to mitochondrial permeability transition, which then results in apoptotic or necrotic cell death. For all mechanisms, mitochondria play a central role in events leading to apoptotic vs. necrotic cell death. New treatment targets consequently focus on interference with downstream pathways that mediate injury and therefore determine the ultimate outcome of DILI. Genome wide and targeted pharmacogenetic as well as metabonomic approaches are now used in order to reach the key goals of a better understanding of mechanisms in hepatotoxicity, and to develop new strategies for its prediction and treatment. However, the complexity of interactions between genetic and environmental risk factors is considerable, and DILI therefore currently remains unpredictable for most hepatotoxins.",

In the context of cystic fibrosis (CF), mouse models have been the dominant species by which to study CF disease processes in vivo for the past two decades. Although much has been learned through these CF mouse models, limitations in the ability of this species to recapitulate spontaneous lung disease and several other organ abnormalities seen in CF humans have created a need for additional species on which to study CF. To this end, pig and ferret CF models have been generated by somatic cell nuclear transfer and are currently being characterized. These new larger animal models have phenotypes that appear to closely resemble human CF disease seen in newborns, and efforts to characterize their adult phenotypes are ongoing. This chapter will review current knowledge about comparative lung cell biology and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) biology among mice, pigs, and ferrets that has implications for CF disease modeling in these species. We will focus on methods used to compare the biology and function of CFTR between these species and their relevance to phenotypes seen in the animal models. These cross-species comparisons and the development of both the pig and the ferret CF models may help elucidate pathophysiologic mechanisms of CF lung disease and lead to new therapeutic approaches.",

This has become realistic due to the existence of the computer aided diagnostic tool. A computer aided diagnostic (CAD) tool generally possesses components like preprocessing, identification/selection of region of interest, extraction of typical features and finally an efficient classification system. This paper enumerates on development of CAD tool for classification of chronic liver disease through the 2-D image acquired from ultrasonic device. Characterization of tissue through qualitative treatment leads to the detection of abnormality which is not viable through qualitative visual inspection by the radiologist. Common liver diseases are the indicators of changes in tissue elasticity. One can show the detection of normal, fatty or malignant condition based on the application of CAD tool thereby, further investigation required by radiologist can be avoided. The proposed work involves an optimal block analysis (64 x 64) of the liver image of actual size 256 x 256 by incorporating Gabor wavelet transform which does the texture classification through automated mode. Statistical features such as gray level mean as well as variance values are estimated after this preprocessing mode. A non-linear back propagation neural network (BPNN) is applied for classifying the normal (vs) fatty and normal (vs) malignant liver which yields a classification accuracy of 96.8%. Further multi classification is also performed and a classification accuracy of 94% is obtained. It can be concluded that the proposed CAD can be used as an expert system to aid the automated diagnosis of liver diseases.",

The evidence base supporting the use of psychotropic medication for children and adolescents with psychiatric disorders has increased for the past 15 to 20 years, as has their use. It is hoped that clinicians who implement the principles outlined in this parameter will be more likely to use medications with the potential for pharmacological benefit in children safely and to reduce the use of ineffective and inappropriate medications or medication combinations. The best practice principles covered in this parameter include completing a psychiatric and medical evaluation, developing a treatment and monitoring plan, educating the patient and family regarding the child's disorder and the treatment and monitoring plan, completing and documenting assent of the child and consent of the parent, conducting an adequate medication treatment trial, managing the patient who does not respond as expected, establishing procedures to implement before using medication combinations, and following principles for the discontinuation of medication.",

        "medline_abstract_text":"Detecting patterns of maternal drinking that place fetuses at risk for fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) is critical to diagnosis, treatment, and prevention but is challenging because information on antenatal drinking collected during pregnancy is often insufficient or lacking. Although retrospective assessments have been considered less favored by many researchers due to presumed poor reliability, this perception may be inaccurate because of reduced maternal denial and/or distortion. The present study hypothesized that fetal alcohol exposure, as assessed retrospectively during child adolescence, would be related significantly to prior measures of maternal drinking and would predict alcohol-related behavioral problems in teens better than antenatal measures of maternal alcohol consumption. Drinking was assessed during pregnancy, and retrospectively about the same pregnancy, at a 14-year follow-up in 288 African-American women using well-validated semistructured interviews. Regression analysis examined the predictive validity of both drinking assessments on pregnancy outcomes and on teacher-reported teen behavior outcomes. Retrospective maternal self-reported drinking assessed 14 years postpartum was significantly higher than antenatal reports of consumption. Retrospective report identified 10.8 times more women as risk drinkers (≥ one drink per day) than the antenatal report. Antenatal and retrospective reports were moderately correlated and both were correlated with the Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test. Self-reported alcohol consumption during pregnancy based on retrospective report identified significantly more teens exposed prenatally to at-risk alcohol levels than antenatal, in-pregnancy reports. Retrospective report predicted more teen behavior problems (e.g., attention problems and externalizing behaviors) than the antenatal report. Antenatal report predicted younger gestational age at birth and retrospective report predicted smaller birth size; neither predicted teen IQ. These results suggest that if only antenatal, in-pregnancy maternal report is used, then a substantial proportion of children exposed prenatally to risk levels of alcohol might be misclassified. The validity of retrospective assessment of prior drinking during pregnancy as a more effective indicator of prenatal exposure was established by predicting more behavioral problems in teens than antenatal report. Retrospective report can provide valid information about drinking during a prior pregnancy and may facilitate diagnosis and subsequent interventions by educators, social service personnel, and health-care providers, thereby reducing the life-long impact of FASDs.",

Fundamental understanding of individual patient's anatomy is critical for optimizing the effects and side effects of DBS surgery. Three patients undergoing stereotactic surgery for movement disorders, at the institution's intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging operating suite, were studied with fiber tractography. Stereotactic targets and fiber tractography were determined on preoperative magnetic resonance imagings using the Schaltenbrand-Wahren atlas for definition in the BrainLab iPlan software (BrainLAB Inc., Feldkirchen, Germany). Subthalamic nucleus, globus pallidus interna, and ventral intermediate nucleus targets were studied. Diffusion tensor imaging parameters used ranged from 2 to 8 mm for volume of interest in the x/y/z planes, fiber length was kept constant at 30 mm, and fractional anisotropy threshold varied from 0.20 to 0.45. Diffusion tensor imaging tractography allowed reliable and reproducible visualization and correlation between frontal eye field, premotor, primary motor, and primary sensory cortices via corticospinal tracts and corticopontocerebellar tracts. There is an apparent increase in the number of cortical regions targeted by the fiber tracts as the region of interest is enlarged. This represents a possible mechanism of the increased effects and side effects observed with higher stimulation voltages. Currently available diffusion tensor imaging techniques allow potential methods to characterize the effects and side effects of DBS. This technology has the potential of being a powerful tool to optimize DBS neurosurgery.",

It is commonly used to predict mortality in patients with cardiac and pulmonary diseases, but it is also useful in assessing the functional status of patients with a variety of other medical conditions. We sought to determine (1) the characteristics of the 6MWD in patients listed for liver transplantation (LT), (2) the existence of a relationship between the 6MWD and the quality of life, and (3) the relationship between the 6MWD and survival in LT candidates. The 6MWD was prospectively measured in all patients listed for LT. The 6MWD was determined when the listed Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score was ≥ 15. Patients were followed until LT, death, removal from the wait list, or the end of the study period. Quality of life was assessed with the Short Form 36 (SF-36). In 121 patients, the mean 6MWD was 369 ± 122 m; it was not related to age, height, weight, body mass index, albumin level, or etiology of liver disease and showed a moderate correlation with the physical component score (PCS) on the SF-36 (r = 0.4) and a moderate inverse correlation with the native MELD score (r = -0.61). In an unadjusted analysis, a high native MELD score, a low 6MWD, and a low PCS were associated with mortality, with only the 6MWD retaining significance after adjustment for covariates. Each 100-m increase in the 6MWD was significantly associated with increased survival (hazard ratio = 0.48, P = 0.0001), with 6MWD < 250 m being associated with an increased risk of death (P = 0.0001). In conclusion, the 6MWD is significantly reduced in patients awaiting LT and is inversely correlated with the native MELD score. A pretransplant 6MWD < 250 m is a risk for death on the wait list.",

CT has a much higher radiation exposure than chest x-ray. The cumulative radiation dose for life-long repeated CT scans has limited its use for CF patients as their life expectancy increases. Clearly, no dose would be preferable over low dose when the same or more relevant information can be obtained. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is comparable to CT with regard to the detection of most morphological changes in the CF lung. It is thought to be less sensitive to detect small airway disease. At the same time, MRI is superior to CT when it comes to the assessment of functional changes such as altered pulmonary perfusion. The recommendation is to further reduce radiation dose related to the use of CT and to use MRI in the follow-up of morphological changes where possible.",

The present article is a systematic review of peer-reviewed publications on the application of L. intracellularis-specific fecal PCR as an antemortem diagnostic test for histologic lesions of PE in pigs. Based on this information, a range of diagnostic sensitivities (36-100%) and specificities (50-100%) of the published tests was calculated. Validity and confidence limits of the estimates varied considerably. The positive and negative predictive values of 6 different PCR assays were calculated for PE prevalence of 15%, 30%, 45%, 60%, 75%, and 90%, using a histologic case definition of PE and based on the reported test sensitivities and specificities. The simulated predictive values suggested that applying the fecal PCR assay as a diagnostic test is more likely to overestimate than underestimate the number of pigs having histologic lesions of PE under field conditions.",

Expression of Ang-1, Ang-2 and endothelial cell-specific tyrosine kinase receptor-2 (Tie-2) mRNA was detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and Ang-1 and Ang-2 protein levels were detected by immunohistochemistry. The RT-PCR results showed significantly decreased Ang-1 expression in the endometrium from IUD patients during both phases compared with the control women. Expression of Tie-2 mRNA and the Ang-1:Ang-2 mRNA ratio were also significantly decreased in endometria from IUD patients in the secretory phase compared with the control women. Immunohistochemical analysis showed elevated Ang-2 protein levels in secretory phase endometrium from IUD patients compared with the control women. These results suggest that the angiopoietin/Tie-2 system promotes vascular remodelling in the endometrium and that changes in the expression of Ang-1, Ang-2 and Tie-2 may contribute to abnormal uterine bleeding in some IUD users.",

Some hints for an association of certain VNTR with psychiatric disorders, behavioural problems and temperament traits have been found. This study explored possible associations between the most frequent DAT1 polymorphism, namely the A10 VNTR, and personality traits as measured by the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI) and the NEO Five Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI) in alcohol-dependent patients (ADP). One hundred and forty-four ADP and 144 age-, educational level- and sex-matched controls (CO) were genotyped and interviewed with the TCI and NEO-FFI. ADP showed higher neuroticism, lower extraversion, lower openness, lower agreeableness and lower conscientiousness than CO on the NEO-FFI and higher scores in harm avoidance, reward dependence and self transcendence and lower scores in self directedness and cooperativeness on the TCI than controls. There were no genetic links regarding those personality traits, the diagnosis of alcohol dependence and the VNTR. Only in a subgroup of ADP, those without psychiatric co-diagnoses and homozygous for A10, significantly lower scores in novelty seeking and higher scores in self directedness than in all the other ADP and CO could be detected. Summarizing, the 40-bp VNTR did not help to differentiate between ADP and CO, but might contribute to some personality dimensions in certain ADP subgroups.",

This review summarizes important mechanisms controlling mRNA processing and the regulation of mRNA degradation, including the role of microRNAs and RNA binding proteins. These pathways provide important opportunities for therapeutic targeting directed at splicing and degradation in order to attenuate genetic defects in RNA metabolism.

This growth is the result of research asking the following three overarching questions: (1) what is the association between family structure, and particularly biological fathers' non-residence, and children's psychopathology, (2) what is the association between fathers' parenting and children's psychopathology, and (3) what is the association between fathers' psychopathology and children's psychopathology. The three broad theoretical perspectives relevant to this literature are the standard family environment model, the passive genetic model, and the child effects model. The evidence from studies comparing the first two models seems to suggest that the origin of the association between parental divorce and children's emotional and behavioral problems is largely shared environmental in origin, as is the association between resident fathers' parenting and children's emotional and behavioral problems, according to studies comparing the standard family environment model with the child effects model. However, research needs to compare appropriately all theoretical perspectives. The paper discusses this, and also points to the importance of considering theory-driven specificity in modeling effects.",

Animal models and immortalized cell lines both have inherent limitations. Explanted lungs removed from people with cystic fibrosis at the time of transplantation represent a potentially valuable but technically and logistically challenging source of primary cystic fibrosis bronchial epithelial cells. In this study, pieces of segmental bronchus from explanted lungs were treated with patient-specific antimicrobials prior to isolation of bronchial epithelial cells. Cultured cells were characterized by their morphology under light microscopy, cytokeratin and hematoxylin-eosin staining, and electrophysiological profile. Primary bronchial epithelial cells were successfully cultured from 15 of 22 patients attempted. The cells exhibited typical epithelial morphology, staining for cytokeratin, lack of responsiveness to forskolin treatment, and remained viable after storage in liquid nitrogen. Seven unsuccessful cultures failed due to early infection with bacteria known to colonize the airways pretransplant. The results show that primary bronchial epithelial cell culture is possible from explanted cystic fibrosis lungs.

        "medline_abstract_text":"The development of alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is a complex process involving both the parenchymal and non-parenchymal cells in the liver. Enhanced inflammation in the liver during ethanol exposure is an important contributor to injury. Kupffer cells, the resident macrophages in liver, are particularly critical to the onset of ethanol-induced liver injury. Chronic ethanol exposure sensitizes Kupffer cells to activation by lipopolysaccharide via Toll-like receptor 4. This sensitization enhances production of inflammatory mediators, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha and reactive oxygen species, that contribute to hepatocyte dysfunction, necrosis, apoptosis, and fibrosis. Impaired resolution of the inflammatory process probably also contributes to ALD. The resolution of inflammation is an active, highly coordinated response that can potentially be manipulated via therapeutic interventions to treat chronic inflammatory diseases. Recent studies have identified an adiponectin/interleukin-10/heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) pathway that is profoundly effective in dampening the enhanced activation of innate immune responses in primary cultures of Kupffer cells, as well as in an in vivo mouse model of chronic ethanol feeding. Importantly, induction of HO-1 also reduces ethanol-induced hepatocellular apoptosis in this in vivo model. Based on these data, we hypothesize that the development of therapeutic agents to regulate HO-1 and its downstream targets could be useful in enhancing the resolution of inflammation during ALD and preventing progression of early stages of liver injury.",

Blacks are underrepresented in large-scale genetic studies of psychiatric disorders. In an effort to understand the reasons for the underrepresentation, this study explored black participants' attitudes towards genetic research of psychiatric disorders. Twenty-six adults, the majority of whom were black (n = 18) were recruited from a New York City community to participate in six 90-minute focus groups. This paper reports findings about respondents' understanding of genetics and genetic research, and opinions about psychiatric genetic research. Primary themes revealed participants' perceived lack of knowledge about genetics, concerns about potentially harmful study procedures, and confidentiality surrounding mental illness in families. Participation incentives included provision of treatment or related service, monetary compensation, and reporting of results to participants. These findings suggest that recruitment of subjects into genetic studies should directly address procedures, privacy, benefits and follow-up with results. Further, there is critical need to engage communities with education about genetics and mental illness, and provide opportunities for continued discussion about concerns related to genetic research.",

We previously showed that anti-dengue virus (DV) nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) Abs cross-react with human platelets and inhibit platelet aggregation. Based on sequence homology alignment, the cross-reactive epitopes reside in the C-terminal region of DV NS1. In this study, we compared the effects of Abs against full-length DV NS1 and NS1 lacking the C-terminal aa 271 to 352 (designated DeltaC NS1). Anti-DeltaC NS1 Abs exhibited lower platelet binding activity than that of anti-full-length NS1. Anti-full-length NS1 but not anti-DeltaC NS1 Abs inhibited platelet aggregation, which was shown to involve integrin alpha(IIb)beta(3) inactivation. We found that the bleeding time in full-length NS1-hyperimmunized mice was longer than that in the normal control mice. By contrast, DeltaC NS1-hyperimmunized mice showed a bleeding time similar to that of normal control mice. Passively administered anti-DV NS1, but not anti-DeltaC NS1, Ab level decreased markedly in serum and this decrease was correlated with Ab binding to platelets. A transient platelet loss in the circulation was observed after anti-DV NS1, but not anti-DeltaC NS1, Ab administration. In summary, platelet dysfunction and bleeding tendency are induced by anti-full-length DV NS1 but not by anti-DeltaC NS1 Abs. These findings may be important not only for understanding dengue hemorrhagic disease pathogenesis but also for dengue vaccine development.",

We used an administrative data file provided information about 23,022 inpatients aged > or =70 years admitted between 2000 and 2006, including vital status at discharge and Charlson comorbidity index and matched it with the result of five blood tests (sodium, potassium, glucose, urea nitrogen, creatinine) within the first 24 h after admission and with daily temperatures before admission. We then measured the prevalence of plasma tonicity (PT) <275 mOsm/l or >300 mOsm/l, blood urea nitrogen/creatinine ratio (BUNC) >100 and inhospital mortality. In 2000-2002, 2003, 2004-2006, prevalence (%) was, respectively 7.5, 8.0, 9.5 (P < 0.0001) for PT < 275 mMol/l, 8.4, 10.4, 7.2 (P < 0.0001) for PT > 300 mOsm/l, and 35.4, 30.7, 26.7 (P < 0.0001) for BUNC > 100. Inhospital mortality rate was 10.8, 10.8 and 9.0%, respectively (P < 0.0001). After adjustment for covariates, OR (95% CI) in 2004-2006 with reference to 2000-2002 was 1.26 (1.13-1.39) for PT < 275 mMol/l, 0.85 (0.76-0.94) for PT > 300 mOsm/l, and 0.65 (0.61-0.69) for BUNC > 100. Inhospital mortality risk associated with hydration disorders did not vary significantly over periods for PT < 275 mMol/l (HR 1.06 to 1.40) and PT > 300 mOsm/l (HR 1.76 to 1.96) but was lower for BUNC > 100 in 2003 (HR 1.27) than in 2000-2002 (HR 1.64) or 2004-2006 (HR 1.77) (P = 0.04).

The injury provoked by such agents includes rapid superficial disruption to the surface layer of the gastric mucosa, the production of acute gastric erosions in the corpus region and the formation of ulcers in the antral region of the stomach. The small intestine is also adversely affected, with a developing enteropathy over a more protracted period that causes lesions and inflammation in the gut. From experimental work, the interactive mechanisms of such damage in the stomach differ distinctly from those that underlie the intestinal injury, yet the damage in both regions involves the inhibition of both COX-1 and COX-2 isoforms. This chapter outlines the in vivo methods that can be used to identify the potential for novel NSAIDs and selective COX-inhibitors to produce acute gastric corpus lesions and more-chronic antral ulcers in the rat, as well as causing small intestinal enteropathy. Such methods can also be utilized to evaluate the ability of novel agents to prevent the gastrointestinal injury provoked by NSAIDs or COX-inhibitors.",

The success of such treatment has resulted in a progressively increasing demand for liver transplantation. However, at the same time the availability of donor organs has diminished, resulting in the number of potential recipients for liver transplantation exceeding organ supply. Several strategies have been explored with the aim to increase access to liver transplantation, including: obtaining organs from non-heart-beating donors and live donors, and splitting and using livers from expanded donor criteria. This article discusses the utility of the mentioned techniques along with other strategies (e.g., Model for End-Stage Liver Disease [MELD] score), as well as the evolution of indications, contraindications, and postoperative care.",

While scientists attest to the discovery of an underlying reality of complex inheritance--the so-called 'witches' brew' of genetic and non-genetic factors--we argue that 'complexity' also performs rhetorical work. In our analysis of scientific review papers (1999-2008), we find a relatively stable genre of accountability in which descriptions of complexity appear to neutralize past failures by incorporating different and sometimes competing methodological perspectives. We identify two temporal strategies: retrospective accounting, which reconstructs a history of psychiatric genetics that deals with the recent failures, citing earlier twin studies as proof of the heritability of common psychiatric disorders; and prospective accounting, which engages in the careful reconstruction of expectations by balancing methodological limitations with moderated optimism. Together, these strategies produce a simple-to-complex narrative that belies the ambivalent nature of complexity. We show that the rhetorical construction of complexity in scientific review papers is oriented to bridging disciplinary boundaries, marshalling new resources and reconstructing expectations that justify delays in gene discovery and risk prediction.",

They arise from mutations causing dysfunction of one of enzymes involved in degradation of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) in lysosomes. Impaired degradation of these compounds results in their accumulation in cells and dysfunction of most tissues and organs of patients. If heparan sulfate (HS) is the sole or one of stored GAGs, brain functions are also affected. However, despite the fact that products of incomplete degradation of the same chemical, HS, are accumulated in brains of patients suffering from Hurler disease (MPS type I), Hunter disease (MPS type II), Sanfilippo disease (MPS type III) and Sly disease (MPS type VII), and obvious deterioration of brain functions occur in these patients, their behavior is considerably different between various types of MPS. Here we asked the question about biochemical reasons of these differences. We performed theoretical analysis of products of incomplete HS degradation that accumulate in tissues of patients diagnosed for these diseases. A correlation between chemical structures of incompletely degraded HS and behaviors of patients suffering from particular MPS types was found. We propose a hypothesis that particular chemical moieties occurring at the ends of incompletely degraded HS molecules may determine characteristic behavioral disturbances, perhaps due to chemical reactions interfering with functions of neurons in the brain. A possible experimental testing of this hypothesis is also proposed. If the hypothesis is true, it might shed some new light on biochemical mechanisms of behavioral problems occurring not only in MPS but also in some other diseases.",

Debates about whether we should continue to depend upon a categorical nosology still continue, but we argue that, despite the absence of clear dividing lines between psychiatric disorders and normality and ubiquity of diagnostic comorbidity, the current official approach to nosology has served child and adolescent psychiatric research surprisingly well. In particular we point to the utility of non-developmental diagnostic criteria as tools for discovering developmental effects on psychopathology. We also maintain that the search for sharper boundaries between disorders is fundamentally mistaken. However, official nosologies have tended to privilege information collected in diagnostic interviews and to sideline observational and other methods that cannot easily be made to conform to the format of their criteria. We suggest that it is time to remedy this situation. The ICD-10 and DSM-IV are useless for children under the age of about two, while alternatives, such as the DC:0-3, suffer from a profound lack of empirical support. We suggest a way forward through the integration of methods from temperament and psychopathology research. Finally, we deplore the failure of standardized assessment techniques to have penetrated more deeply into everyday clinical assessment.",

However, such studies are scarce partly due to the lack of efficient tools. Here we describe and provide proof of concept for a stereo vision system that classifies and sequentially records at an extremely fine scale six different behaviors (resting, micro-movement, walking, flying, feeding and drinking) and the within-cage (3D) location of individual tephritid fruit flies by time-of-day throughout their lives. Using flies fed on two different diets, full sugar-yeast and sugar-only diets, we report for the first time their behavioral changes throughout their lives at a high resolution. We have found that the daily activity peaks at the age of 15-20 days and then gradually declines with age for flies on both diets. However, the overall daily activity is higher for flies on sugar-only diet than those on the full diet. Flies on sugar-only diet show a stronger diurnal localization pattern with higher preference to staying on the top of the cage during the period of light-off when compared to flies on the full diet. Clustering analyses of age-specific behavior patterns reveal three distinct young, middle-aged and old clusters for flies on each of the two diets. The middle-aged groups for flies on sugar-only diet consist of much younger age groups when compared to flies on full diet. This technology provides research opportunities for using a behavioral informatics approach for understanding different ways in which behavior, movement, and aging in model organisms are mutually affecting.",

Its exposure is associated with impairment in the cholinergic system in the brain. In this study we investigated the behavioral effects of aluminum in rats and the possible effect of rivastigmine, a cholinesterase inhibitor, on the aluminum-induced behavioral changes. Rats were exposed to aluminum chloride (100 mg/kg/day i.p.) for 60 days before the start of behavioral tests. Rivastigmine was given in doses of 0.5, 1, 1.5 and 2.5 mg/kg i.p. 60 min before the behavioral tests. Five tests were investigated; open field test, Morris water maze, radial arm maze, passive avoidance test and rota-rod test. Results showed that aluminum exposure was associated with significant reductions in spontaneous locomotor and exploratory activities in open field test and significant impairments in learning and memory in Morris water maze, radial arm maze and passive avoidance tests. The behavioral impairments caused by aluminum were significantly improved by rivastigmine. Neither aluminum alone nor co-treatment with rivastigmine caused any significant alteration of the animals' performance in rota-rod test. The improvements in activity, learning and memory caused by rivastigmine were found to be dose-dependent, and the maximal improvement was encountered with its large dose (2.5 mg/kg). From these results we can conclude that rivastigmine can reverse behavioral deficits caused by aluminum intoxication.",

Applications of these MR imaging-quantifiable parameters to abdominal imaging include oncologic imaging, evaluation of diffuse liver disease, and assessment of splenic, renal, and pancreatic disease. An understanding of the inherent physical principles underlying the basic quantitative parameters as well as the commonly used pulse sequences requisite to their derivation is critical, as this field is rapidly growing and its use will likely continue to expand in the clinic.

        "medline_abstract_text":"Access to liver transplantation is reportedly inequitable for racial/ethnic minorities, but inadequate adjustments for geography and disease progression preclude any meaningful conclusions. We aimed to evaluate the association between candidate race/ethnicity and liver transplant rates after thorough adjustments for these factors and to determine how uniform racial/ethnic disparities were across Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) scores. Chronic end-stage liver disease candidates initially wait-listed between February 28, 2002 and February 27, 2007 were identified from Scientific Registry for Transplant Recipients data. The primary outcome was deceased donor liver transplantation (DDLT); the primary exposure covariate was race/ethnicity (white, African American, Hispanic, Asian, and other). Cox regression was used to estimate the covariate-adjusted DDLT rates by race/ethnicity, which were stratified by the donation service area and MELD score. With averaging across all MELD scores, African Americans, Asians, and others had similar adjusted DDLT rates in comparison with whites. However, Hispanics had an 8% lower DDLT rate versus whites [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.92, P = 0.011]. The disparity among Hispanics was concentrated among patients with MELD scores < 20, with HR = 0.84 (P = 0.021) for MELD scores of 6 to 14 and HR = 0.85 (P = 0.009) for MELD scores of 15 to 19. Asians with MELD scores < 15 had a 24% higher DDLT rate with respect to whites (HR = 1.24, P = 0.024). However, Asians with MELD scores of 30 to 40 had a 46% lower DDLT rate (HR = 0.54, P = 0.004). In conclusion, although African Americans did not have significantly different DDLT rates in comparison with similar white candidates, race/ethnicity-based disparities were prominent among subgroups of Hispanic and Asian candidates. By precluding the survival benefit of liver transplantation, this inequity may lead to excess mortality for minority candidates.",

While magnetic resonance based imaging techniques are able to provide complex information on a system level, positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computer tomography (SPECT) allow for determination of distribution and density of single receptor molecules in the human brain. Major psychiatric disorders are highly heritable, and have been associated with a dysregulation in brain dopamine and serotonin systems. Understanding the role of genetic polymorphisms within these neurotransmitter systems on brain phenotype is essential. This review tries to cover the literature on the impact of gene variants implicated in psychiatric disorders on serotonin, dopamine, and MAO-A radioligand binding in living humans. The majority of PET and SPECT studies investigated the role of polymorphisms within genes coding for the serotonin and dopamine transporters, the serotonin 1A receptor, and the dopamine D2 receptor on G protein coupled receptors or transporter proteins critically involved in serotonin or dopamine neurotransmission. Other studies investigated the impact of variants in genes for monoamine oxidase-A (MAO-A) or brain derived neurotrophic factor on monoamine transporters, receptors, or MAO-A activity. Two main findings in healthy subjects emerge from the current literature: one is an increased binding of the selective ligand [(11)C]DASB to serotonin transporters in subjects homozygous for the triallelic 5-HTTLPR LA allele. The other one is decreased binding of the radioligand [(11)C]raclopride to dopamine D2 receptors in D2 Taq1 A1 allele carriers. Other findings reported are highly interesting but require independent replication.",
